I did too. But this book was far from it. I have added some recommendations at the end of the review for those who are looking for good Muslim reps. <U>BELIEVE ME, this is not the book you're looking for. </U><br/><br/>●◇●◇●◇●◇●◇●◇●◇●◇●◇●◇●◇●<br/><br/>Hear that faint shriek in the distance? Yeah, that’s probably me screaming over this book.<br/><br/><b>H   O   R   R   I   B   B   L   E</b><br/><br/>When I saw this book on my feed – <b><br/>-	The MC is an Indian Teen. </b>Indian. Teen. In. America. I NEED I NEED I NEED IT<br/><b><br/>-	Muslim Rep. </b>OMG. (Yeah, there’s seriously too less of them. WE NEED DIVERSE YA) </b><br/><br/>See, <b>I am an Indian Muslim Teen. </b>I might not have seen America, but still, I knew I had to get this book and read it asap. Plus the reviews were all 5-starred! BONUS!<br/><br/>Only, when you’re expecting to see yourself represented in a book, the book has a way of unduly disappointing you. <b> I am so so frustrated by the rep in this book. </b><br/><br/>If you don’t know the plot yet, Maya Aziz is a 17 year old living in Illinois with her immigrant, conservative parents. She loves making movies and intends to make a career out of it. She has a crush on a long-time classmate Phil. Her parents try to set her up with Kareem, a boy they deem suitable. Maya’s dreams of going to NYU for studies are crushed by the aftermath of a terrorist attack she has no role in.<br/><br/>Seems stuffy, doesn’t it?<br/>Well, be disappointed because –<br/><br/><b>¤• THE ONLY FOCUS HERE IS ROMANCE.</b> You’d think that with a Muslim MC, romance might be the last thing to expect. But no, <b>Maya has a crush on Phil, a Christian boy.</b> They go on dates, swimming lessons IN A BIKINI, kiss, hold hands and spend a night together. This is a forbidden relationship in Islam, and the only thing Maya is worried about is her parents grounding her?! She couldn’t even acknowledge the fact that what she is doing is <i>wrong</i> in her morals?<br/><blockquote><br/>-	 And btw, in the end, she’s romancing another guy, a Hindu nonetheless. After all the fussing and falling over Phil, she moves on to another guy. Way to go, binch!<br/>-	The supposedly cute romance was way too fluffy. Like made-to-feel-this-way fluff. Like, they-are-too-cute-together-omigod fluff.<br/>-	I couldn’t think of anything those two had in common. Except, maybe a crush on each other. <br/>-	I know, I shouldn’t be disappointed to see a Muslim girl romancing a Christian boy. Everyone has a right to date whoever they want.<br/>-	But <b>she never acknowledges her religion,</b> doesn’t give it a second thought. It’s like she was saving face, trying to play cool by not saying out loud that NO, MUSLIMS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DATE. BUT I WANT TO SO I DO. <b>Someone’s ashamed of her beliefs.</b>  </blockquote><br/><br/><b>¤• MAYA IS A TERRIBLE EXCUSE FOR A MUSLIM MC.</b> Does she pray ever? NO. Does she even say ‘I’m a Muslim’? NO. Does she ever say or do anything on her own that remotely signifies a Muslim? NO.<br/>I have no idea, why this book was branded as Muslim rep. <b>Maya Aziz, is a Muslim only by her last name.</b> I wonder if that’s the reason why everybody thinks this book is diverse.<b> Maya’s religion is used as a plot device, to be the butt of terrorist jokes and nothing else.</b> <br/><blockquote><br/>-	So there’s one time, when<b> Kareem drinks wine in front of Maya and she seems shocked.</b><br/>-	What do they do, then? <b>Laugh over it as if it’s a joke.</b> Say <b>“it’s not like I’m eating pork”!!</b><br/>-	Who ever said,<b> drinking wine is allowed and pork is not??</b> BOTH ARE FORBIDDEN FOR MUSLIMS AND ONE IS NOT WORSE THAN THE OTHER. And if you don’t act over it, you at least state the fact Maya, not joke over it because it doesn’t matter to you.<br/>-	Yeah, not all Muslim girls are hijabis, pray 5 times a day and not drink wine. But <b>doesn’t being a Muslim rep come with its responsibilities? </b> Like say, explain her Islamic ways? <br/>-	If Maya never had a Muslim last name, or if it was not specifically mentioned in the blurb, I wouldn’t have thought Maya was Muslim, or pick up the book in the first place.<br/>-	<b>It is just clever marketing strategy. </b> SAY YOUR MC IS MUSLIM, THAT YOU REPRESENT DIVERSE CULTURE, AND YOUR BOOK SELLS. HOW CONVENIENT FOR YOU SAMIRA AHMED.</blockquote><br/><br/><b>¤• THE ACT OF TERRORISM SEEMED JUSTIFIED. </b> See, at the end of each chapter, there’s a small narrative in third person, about the terrorist guy Ethan. It is basically about how his Dad was abusive, how he was deeply affected by an unhappy childhood, <b>just how shitty his life is.</b> I could not see a reason why that had to be included? <b>It was totally unnecessary. </b>At first I was lost on these narratives. Then I realized that Samira Ahmed is trying to give us the terrorists’ view of why he did what he did. <b> It was like she was covering up for his acts.</b><br/><blockquote><br/>-	I mean, I get he was mentally unstable and all that, but <b>his morbid past is no excuse for his morbid sins.</b><br/>-	It was as if the author wanted to say ‘This poor guy had an abusive childhood, Let’s all sympathize him’</b> <br/>-	What frustrates me though, is that, if a muslim guy attacks, then it would have been like <b>”That guy has a beard, he’s muslim. He must be a terrorist!”</b> How convenient is having a beard and a muslim name, to say he is a terrorist.?? <br/>-	<b>It’s like she was saying this guy who is a terrorist and not muslim, has his own reasons</b>. wth?<br/>-	BUT I’M GLAD SAMIRA AHMED TRIED TO SHOW THAT <B>TERRORISM HAS NO RELIGION</B>. I’m just not convinced it was what she actually meant. <br/>-	Also, the subplot started at like 50% into the story, and was over in a few pages. After that back to the romance. <br/>-	Why did she even bother?<b> Seems to me it was just to spice up the story. </b></blockquote><br/><br/><b>¤• THE INDIAN REP</B>.<br/> Basically, <u>all you’ll get to know about India from this book is that Indian parents are oppressive and we eat samosas all the time.</u> <br/>Which is utterly FALSE.<b> Indians are diverse, we eat a variety of food, and not all Indian parents try to contain their kids.</b> And why I was disappointed with the rep was because <b>Maya seemed to hate her culture, her background, her house that smelled of onions.</b> I can see why someone who was born and bought up in America might not be fond of Indian culture which is far off to her. But that doesn’t mean you can’t embrace your difference. That doesn’t make you any more American than it makes you any less Indian.<br/>-	It was very relatable though. <br/>-	Parents bugging you to settle down.<br/>-	Those tasty yummy home food.<br/>-	The colorful Indian wedding.<br/>-	Sorry, but it all gets drowned in the fluff of the romance.<br/><br/><b>¤• DESI COMPULSIVE PARENTS</b>. <br/>I was so glad to see this bought up in this book. <b>Someone finally acknowledges how hard it is to live with conservative parents, who dreams your share of dreams too. </b><br/> Maya wants to go to Film School in New York City, and her parents allow only after a lot of prodding. But after the terrorist attack, they prohibit her from going, and DISOWN her for deciding to go on her own. Yeah, that stuff still happens, yeah that sucks. <b>But usually they do come around in the end</b>. <br/><blockquote><br/>-	I hope it wasn’t written to feel like it was just Indian parents.<br/>-	Because seriously, that happens all around the world. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/><b>¤• MAYA IS JUST SO RUDE</b> . She has no love for her parents; she was just rude to them. Yeah, I know, her parents weren’t all that supportive, but they loved her. <br/>My parents are conservative and oppressive, but still I don’t raise my voice at them. Not just because of respect, because they’re my PARENTS. <br/><blockquote><br/>-	And Maya doesn’t give a heck about anything. As soon as she is out of her parents’ sight, she goes on a kissing spree.<br/>-	<b>She says she wants to be independent</b>.<br/>-	But <b>why does being independent have to mean dating and kissing as many boys as I can?</b><br/>-	Like, why can’t it just be – I am on my own, I am free to do what I please, and I don’t care what anyone thinks? <br/>-	NO. For Maya, independence means she can go to prom and makeout.<br/>-	That’s the same girl who couldn’t even find her voice when Brian cornered her in a food court. <br/>-	<b>She was such a scaredy-cat then</b>. Where was all that bravado with her parents?<br/>-	I mean, it was a food court for god’s sake. Couldn’t she like, scream?<br/>-	Another thing, she talks about so many movies and some books I don’t have any idea about, and well, spoils them all. <b>No I don’t like spoilers even if I probably am not going to watch those movies or read those books</b>. Thanks.</blockquote><br/><br/>On a forward note, <b> please don’t pick this book expecting a realistic, accurate Muslim Rep. </b> Go for the fluff, the romance. I know this is an #OwnVoices book, and Samira Ahmed shares her story, but when you put a label on yourself, at least try to do it some justice. That’s all I’ve got to say.<br/><br/><br/><b>For those who are looking for alternatives, here are some suggestions- </b> In no particular order<br/>▪~[b:Love From A to Z|40148146|Love From A to Z|S.K.

It also shows the author’s own skeptical beliefs on making a living as a writer, firmly establishing how all forms of literature are valid and worthy of being read.<br/><br/>The characters themselves go through amazing development from start to finish. Each of them signify a very different aspect of human nature; I can be pretty sure that had it not been Austen writing them, the characters would have fallen short as flat and one-dimensional, but no, she has a very peculiar way of breathing life into them. I dearly loved Catherine Morland, and the Tilney siblings were my favorite. The descriptions of Bath, and the simple conversations between the characters, the dialogues, and the way Austen talks about books and defends Gothic literature, was lovely. I really appreciate how Austen speaks on these topics given the time and circumstances that this book was written in. Plus, Catherine is a huge reader! (but I have zero idea about those authors she talks of :3 )<br/><br/>The book wasn’t at par with Pride and Prejudice for me, but I see no reason to rate it any less.

With time, both of them grow apart and go their separate ways. The strong bond they shared during their early years has turned into a feeble friendship, but is once again put to test when Zaynoona’s mother dies.<b> This is a story of friendship, recovery, and discovering oneself while learning to live with the past.</b><br/><b><br/>My emotions while reading this book can easily be represented as an exponential graph.</b> In the initial stage when you get to know the characters, I was kinda detached to them, especially Rekiya, who had more of a ‘tell-not-show’ kinda arc. There are so many references of her past that we aren’t aware of, which made it difficult to connect to her emotionally. On the other hand, Zaynoonah’s character was lovely right from the beginning. Z’s mom was adorable. The bonding in their family despite their conservatism was commendable. <br/><br/>Through the two main characters, we get to see two different hemispheres of humanity - the rich who has seen suffering, and the middle-class who doesn’t realize the privilege of their loving family.<b> The buildup of the storyline was crafted so beautifully that when it finally hits you what it has been telling you all along, the blow is severe.</b> I could relate so much to Zaynoonah’s understanding of Rekiya’s trauma, how she reflects upon her undramatic life, and how she realizes the importance of not taking everything for granted. Rekiya’s story was so easy to sympathize with once the realization hits.<br/><br/>I also loved how we were taken through Nigerian cities so graciously, describing the nature and culture of the people, and the Islamic traditions (which aren’t very different from ours btw) among practicing and non-practicing Muslims. <b>The representation was spot-on and natural,</b> at times I forgot I was supposed to take notes of the representation because everything was perfectly captured.<br/><br/>I can be nitpicky and say that the only thing I felt a bit lacking was Rekiya’s healing process.<b> Her recovery from trauma, and her discovering religion was a bit quick. </b>I would have loved a deeper exploration of what attracted her to Islam, and why she found solace in religion after so many years of not practicing. Although,<b> the Hajj and Umrah descriptions were absolutely phenomenal, and undoubtedly my favorite part of the book. </b>I think those few pages beautifully captured the deepest desire of every Muslim soul.<br/><br/>Towards the end, the characters simply grow on you.<b> I found myself thinking what a particular character would say and think in a scene they weren’t present in - </b>and I think that is the biggest compliment I could give the author. Still, the ENDING will shook you. I certainly wasn’t prepared, but I can’t think of any other way I’d have liked it to end. <br/><b><br/>This book emphasizes normality in terms of religion, mental health, marriage, and healing, all the while allowing you to glimpse the lifestyle of Nigerian Muslims. </b><br/><br/>It was one of a kind reading experience for me, and I’m sure it would be for you too. Absolutely recommend it!<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Honestly, the first few chapters were hard. It was brutal, and gruesome to read about rape in a way that made the victim feel like it was her fault. Basically, sex with partial consent due to bullying/threatening. TW: Rape, bullying, domestic violence - a bit graphical.<br/><br/>Jacob, Izzy's classmate, has been threatening her with photos taken inappropriately at a party they were at. This leads to her agreeing to go over to his place so he would keep the photos a secret. Meanwhile, her best friend is spending too much time with her girlfriend which makes Izzy feel more lonely. At the same time, her stepdad is a monster in a George Clooney disguise. Soon Izzy finds that the spiral is out of control. Coming out of it seems almost impossible to her. <br/><br/>Like I said, it was difficult in the start, and Izzy's character was a bit intimidating. We don't get to know much about her at first except that she's being raped and that she thinks it's her fault. The slow growth eventually blows to an exceptionally beautiful character development, unexpected twists and some lovely bonding. Izzy was easy to sympathise, but not that easy to love. She is constantly pissed at her Mom for not standing up for her. She's always jealous of her best friend's girlfriend for stealing their time together. And the one boy who actually decided to help her about the Jacob issue, she pushes him away and barely acknowledges his effort. But all these little flaws helped make her a very realistic person by the end. The author tries to show us that it was okay to have insecurities, that having strong emotions is normal. Also, it's been a long time since I've read about such strong friendship as Grace and Izzy's. I loved how verbal they were, how open about their feelings. The relationship with her Mom was complicated, but touching and profound. Harry though, his character stole the show even with the short time he was introduced for. <br/><br/>All in all, I think this book is a must read for all. Girls, you get to learn about victim-shaming, and boys, you gotta understand proper consent. Such a beautiful debut for Amy Beashel.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Well, I experienced it for the first time now. While Daisy Rockwell has done a splendid job of translating Mastur's book, I feel like this book would have been much much better had I read the original Urdu version.<br/><br/>The Promised Land is all about a found-family trying to cope up with each other while living in dire political circumstances. Sajidah is taken to a mansion by two friendly-looking strangers from a refugee camp in Pakistan. While they were decent people with good intentions, Sajidah has a hard time adjusting to her new life, especially with the new people around her.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this book was how the writing conflicted itself each time. One moment Sajidah is very caring and emotional towards Taji, the household servant. But in the next, she'd say something rude and condescending to put her in her place. There were many such conflicting personalities throughout the vents in this book which just didn't sit right by me.<br/><br/>I didn't like the main character Sajidah, tbh. <br/><br/>I did not like how the book tried to imply that 'educated' people did not have to do household work, that servants are always lower than the people who are educated. This was implied many times, which seemed odd for a book that seemed to put a lot of emphasis on modern thinking.<br/><br/>While the characters themselves aren't deep, the plot is more about the politicl tension and how one's surroundings and circumstances shape the way they live. <br/><br/>This story provided a good background of Indians who were forced to migrate due to the partiton. But the writing and the characters didn't leave a lasting impact on me, so I'm afraid this book would soon be forgotten.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Her curiosity about her paternal family, the stigma and stereotypes she faced because of her heritage, and the stark contrast of her pretend-life as a rich guy's girlfriend versus her actual hidden reality - there is a lot to learn from this book.

The humorous exterior she built for herself can only last so long when the whole nation has seen her private parts and is calling her a slut. The only thing she has going in her favor is her best friend Ajita, and being shortlisted for a popular screenplay-writing competition, and her grandmother’s undeserving support. But when the world seems intent on making things worse, she can only do one thing – find out who doth bought this wrath on her. <br/><br/>Izzy is thoughtless, careless, and every other good characteristic traits that come to mind – less. Sending a guy nudes just because he asked her, and revealing personal information about her best friend, <b>and she expects us to feel sorry for her when some of her personal business leaks out??</b> Like, tell me, what would you do when a guy sends you his nude and asks you to do the same? That’s creepy and insulting and SO NOT FUN in any twisted way. NO, I don’t think she deserves what she got, I don’t think people have any right to judge her for her stupid choices, but I do believe she should have thought twice before doing all she did. And yeah, it’s not just the girl, but the boys are equally to be blamed. <br/><br/><b>I don’t get what the book was trying to tell me. </b>Do not regret having sex with strangers even when you have all the reason in the world to do just that? <b>Or just go and have sex with anybody you want, because it’s nobody’s goddamn business?</b> <u>iT iS eVERYBODY’S dAMN bUSINESS wHEN yOU dO iT iN a gARDEN bENCH iN pUBLIC, yOU sTUPID gIRL!</u> If she needed privacy, and her sexcapades to be a secret, she should know better than to do it in front of everyone. Idk, I WAS JUST SO FRUSTRATED WITH IZZY ALRIGHT??! <B>And her sense of humor while good at times, made me sick.</b> And the plot device that was supposedly a plot-twist? It was so obvious. <spoiler> Danny was really a great guy in the beginning. And she just twisted his character to be the evil guy for no reason at all. And I don’t understand his justification for what he did to Izzy. I really couldn’t buy it. </spoiler>. I think the author wasn’t convincing enough with her reasons for revenge porn. It’s not explained how the events turned out the way it did. <u>While I did feel sorry for Izzy at times, it still angers me that she hasn’t learned from her mistakes.</u> <b> So much happens to her, but she is still immature and stupid. There’s no character growth, no development.</b> And the unnecessary feministic approach in the end? Uff, where does it all fit? True, the boys are as much to blame as Izzy, and true, her sex life is her choice and nobody gets to judge her for being her. <b>But you know, it’s very un-feministic to bring up feminism to defend your honor.</b> She was irrational, and also no grandma in the world would actually support their grand-daughter like Izzie's did. It was all just too much.<b> You can do whatever you want, Izzy O’Neill, but you can’t ask others to like your nymphomaniac tendencies. </b> JUST LIKE IT’S NOT ANYBODY’S BUSINESS WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR BODY, IT’S NOT YOUR BUSINESS TO JUDGE OTHERS’ WAY OF PERCEIVING THINGS.<br/><br/>Plus, Izzy wasn’t a good friend. Correction, she was a TERRIBLE TERRIBLE FRIEND. But atleast she accepted that fact and made up for it, even if she didn’t even deserve Ajita’s friendship. And please, NO ONE, not one parent would like it when their teenage kid sleeps with guys/girls just for fun. I wouldn’t want my future child to read this book and think it’s okay to be like Izzy O’Neill. <br/>YUP, IT ISN’T YOUR FAULT IF YOUR NUDE PICTURES GET LEAKED, IF YOU’RE CAUGHT ON CAMERA HAVING SEX, IF EVERYBODY’S INTERESTED IN YOUR GODDAMN SEX LIFE. BUT THE LEAST YOU CAN DO IS BE CAUTIOUS OF YOURSELF. TRY TO KEEP YOUR PRIVATE LIFE, PRIVATE. BUT IF YOU CAN HAVE SEX IN AN OPEN PLACE, YOU CAN’T BLAME SOMEONE ELSE FOR EXISTING THERE AT THE MOMENT.<br/><br/><b>Verdict ? </b> Please, this is a book with an unnaturally cool-headed protagonist with a twisted sense of humor, and you can do without it in your life. I’d never willingly want my kids to read this book. <b>So basically, it’s not a book I’d recommend. </b><br/><br/><br/><br/>---------------------<br/><br/><b>Initial Review -</b><br/><br/>Guys, this book is The Exact Opposite Of Okay.<br/><br/><b>IT DOES COMPLETE JUSTICE TO ITS TITLE</b>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I loved the previous two books and didn't want something dreadful to happen. Like, what if Lara Jean ended up with John Ambrose  McClaren?! *shudders*<br/>But I should have known. It's Jenny Han writing after all. And everything she writes is just about perfect. This book is no exception. <br/><br/>Lara Jean is graduating high school. Two years back when her sister Margot had to leave for college, she broke up with her boyfriend. But Lara Jean has it all planned out. She and Peter are going to UVA and would still be together. Or, will they?<br/>Life doesn't happen as planned out. Amidst all the chaos at her home, preparing for a wedding, she must decide how to go on with life. And Peter. <br/><br/>The way Jenny Han makes the characters come to life with the simplest of words is just amazing. I love the characters. Lara Jean, Peter K, Kitty, Margot, Dr. Covey, they all have this endearing charm about them which makes them more and more real. <br/><br/>Being a high school gradate this year myself, I could relate to everything Lara Jean goes through. The dread of final results, the anxiety of getting the confirmation letters from college, the nostalgic feeling when you walk through the school for the last time, farewell parties. I lived it all once more.<br/><br/><blockquote><b>""Everyone knows where they're going, and right now already feels like it's in the rearview. Suddenly life feels fast and slow at the same time.

This book did that and more - more because, when I say cliched, it isn't bad. This book had a surprising depth. You know what's going to happen and yet it manages to take you off-guard. <br/><br/><b>I LOVED IT.</b><br/><br/>It's Hong Kong in the present world. We have Lucky, the K-Pop sensation, a teenager, who's suffocated with her lifestyle even though she is literally living her dream. Then we have Jack, who's interning at his dad's bank against his will, doing photography for a tabloid magazine on the side. Jack doesn't know a thing about K-Pop and Lucky hasn't been in the outside world for a long time.<br/><br/>The two of them cross paths when Lucky decides to leave her hotel room for the night to have a hamburger. They end up spending a day together, traveling around Hong Kong.<br/><br/>Lucky doesn't know that Jack has been photographing her the whole time. Jack didn't know he'd end up falling for her. <br/><b><u><br/>It's dreams against desires, reality against hope, success against happiness. </b></u><br/><br/>♦ Right from the start, we are introduced to this fascinating world of K-Pop through Lucky's music. I adored the musical descriptions here. <b>They were magical. </b>Maurene Goo definitely has a way with words. While we see the shiny made-up exterior of K-Pop stars, the book gives us a glimpse into the harsh conditions of singers working under management labels. <b>Who knew these singers weren't getting paid enough for their songs?</b> Did you know about the one-cup diet these singers are put through? I mean, seriously! My evening snack itself comprises packets of processed foods and these performers aren't allowed more than one cup of, like, salad, for an entire day! *shudders*<br/><br/>♦ <b>Like I said, informative and eye-opening.</b> The diversity and difference in American and Korean cultures are very visible.<br/> <br/>♦ My favorite part was the<b> sight-seeing.</b> We get a virtual tour through the entirety of Hong Kong, though I did wish there were more of the descriptions of the places. <br/><br/>♦ And <B>the food</b>, goddammit why do books have to make me hungry ugh. Not to forget <b><i>all the talking.</i></b> OHMYGOD. I have so missed seeing real uncensored conversations in YA. Jack and Lucky talk about everything under the sun that matters. <b>Their conversations were so deep and pungent </b>that I found stopping to think about them, highlighting every other dialogue. <b>Some of the observations about following your dreams were like a punch in the gut. </b>Don't get me wrong - I've read enough of those in books. But the situations that gave rise to these conversations in the book really hit me hard. <br/><br/>♦ The best thing about the romance and the interactions was the<b> realisticity</b> (is that even a word?!). The awkwardness between potential lovers, the urge to feel and appear good and sophisticated - these norms were not only broken down, but also acknowledged and laughed over. You don't find that in YA books.<br/> <br/>♦ There was this insta-love kinda spark in the beginning, but I really liked how the author managed it. Two people who were attracted to each other, but also genuinely interested in what the other person wanted.<b> It was like Before Sunrise, but set in Hong Kong, with a runaway celeb and possibility of a scandal.</b> Wooh, I like that.<br/><br/>♦ The character development was palpable. Lucky's celebrity persona and the Lucky we see with Jack aren't very different, but they were pretty distinguishable. Yet there wasn't any of the I'm-different-with-him sorta crap. I felt that she was confusing at times. <b>The overall strength of her character though, and the way she spoke for all the determined, confident young girls out there, was truly inspiring.</b> Jack, on the other hand was the normal confused teen with no idea what to do with his life. These <b>contrasting personalities and the way the author develops them towards the end of the story</b>, was quite commendable. <br/><br/>♦ The main reason this wasn't a five-star read for me were <b>the clichés. </b>Towards the end, while Lucky's real persona is revealed and the paparazzies take over, a lot of stuff happens that even a five-year-old could have anticipated. <b>There is also the issue of the whole story happening in just a day.</b> Granted, it was an amazing day. <b>But how cliched is it that one day with two people lying to each other all the time ends up with the couple falling in love? </b>I also felt that Jack's 'conversation' with his parents was too good to be true. I know what Asian parents are like, and part of the reason I related to him was because he knew what his parents were like too. That simple confrontation in the end was soo quick and convenient -it was annoying. <br/><br/>♦ But there was this slight twist too, <b>the ending was not what I expected. It was GOOD, and way more realistic. </b>It gave closure to many of the problems and themes addressed in the book. It was slightly rushed, but I liked it. <br/><br/>♦ <b>This book was a different experience </b>even though I've read YA romcoms with K-Pop stars before (it was baaad). Two adorable, realistic teens spending a day wandering around Hong Kong, eating all sorts of food, with enough drama to spice it up - <b>I think it's worth a read. </b><br/><br/>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/><br/><b><u>P.S.</b></u> This book reminded me of [b:Tweet Cute|45045129|Tweet Cute|Emma Lord|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1558456354l/45045129._SY75_.jpg|66924806]. Teens + food + angsty drama + romance. Plus, the Jacks in both the books were soo similar that I'm starting to wonder whether it was more than a coincidence.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Instead, she is stuck as a PA to her demanding boss Vanessa, has a stinky, good-for-nothing roommate, and now her boss wants her to undertake the construction of her holiday home in Little Heaton, a town in the middle of nowhere. When Rebecca gets there, she isn't sure how she would ever get the job done. But by accident, she is mistaken to be Vanessa Whitley herself. Utilizing her boss's fiery reputation, Rebecca starts ordering the workers to move up the job and is surprised by the power that her change in name gets her. But things don't go as planned as one lie leads to another and she finds herself in a mess... and maybe in love.<br/><br/>The premise was very promising, but I thought that what the book had in concept, it lost in its execution. Rebecca's character has very little characterization. There was nothing distinguishing her from Rebecca as pretend-Vanessa or the real-Rebecca. Another thing I wasn't impressed by was that most of the characters are stereotypical embodiments. Vanessa is made out to be this feisty hot-tempered boss, but we don't actually see her living up to her bad reputation. Her character is over-exaggerated, which made the whole thing unrealistic for me. On the other hand, Rebecca's flat mate is the sexist, dirty guy, and to think he didn't notice her absence for three weeks says a lot. The only character I liked was Stacey's. Oliver was fine as a love-interest, but I wished there were more dialogue and confrontation between Rebecca and the rest of the workers after her true identity is out. <br/><br/>Most of the plot was very predictable - the romance subplot, Rebecca's career turn, Emma's development, Vanessa's turnaround - everything turned out exactly the way I anticipated, and this predictability made it uninteresting. Overall, while the writing is definitely unique to the author, the story is your average contemporary romance. If you're in the mood for a light comedy, you would love the book.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

But this book was so well-written and the narrative so personal that it broke my expectations. I loved reading how Theresa Fuller explains her childhood and listening to folktales from an early age. Being an Asian myself, I'm familiar with most of the stories and I've heard or read renditions of a few of them myself. It was really refreshing to read the same stories with Asian characters, in an Asian setting. This book mainly takes inspiration from Singaporean/Malay and Chinese folktales, but I'm sure most of us would have heard one or two of these stories growing up.<br/><br/>However, the reason for my lower rating is that I couldn't enjoy the final story, The Girl Who Became a Goddess, all that much. The author explains how this story is her favorite and that she has taken liberties with narrating it her way. It also takes up about half the book and is the only story that spans more than one chapter. But I found Chang E's story of the ten sons a little too underwhelming for my liking, even though it was written quite well.<br/><br/>This book is short and quick. Anybody who enjoys some good folktales and a nostalgic ride through their childhood of believing in the impossible would definitely like this book.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The first 80% of it was confusing and kept me guessing - trying to arrange and rearrange the pieces in a way that made sense. But after that, it started to become enticing. I was completely immersed in it, learning what was happening, and being satisfied by the fact that whatever I figured out turned out to be true. But yet there was this one missing piece that wouldn't fall into place, the one piece that kept me reading. When it came, when it got me so completely engrossed in it, boom! the book's over. And I was left awestruck. <br/><br/>Charm & Strange is absolutely that - A charming and strange story of a boy named Andrew Winston Winters. The book is narrated in alternating timelines - matter; which is the present, where Win is a 16-year-old in a boarding school in London, and anti-matter; where Drew is a 10-year-old living with his family. Anything else I say about the plot would be a spoiler. But if you decide to read this book (and you must) then know that this book isn't paranormal. It isn't fantasy. It's hauntingly real. The author leaves a lot of it to our imagination, but those are easy. It's the impact of it that's unbearable. It's going to open your eyes. You'll figure out the WHY pretty soon, but the HOW will keep you reading till the end. If nothing else, the writing style is enough to keep you hooked.<br/><br/>This is why I am so confused over rating this book. I want to rate it 2 because it was frustrating - the not knowing for so long. But I also want to rate it more than 4, because after all, the wait was worth it in the end. This book was so beautiful and haunting and emotionally scarring and got me reading till the end no matter what ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It was light and funny and full of adventures and stories, I have a hard time believing it’s a debut. This book is a refreshing new voice in YA literature, is filled with humor and charismatic characters that’d make you root for them till the end. Also, finally, finally there’s a YA book by a male author featuring a male protagonist that’s not John Green or Patrick Ness. Yay!<br/><br/>Two Like Me and You might mislead you with its cover and title, because this book isn’t exclusively about romance. It’s about two high school kids and an old man. Edwin Green is fed up of people at school asking him about his ex-girlfriend Sadie Evans, who is now a highly popular Hollywood star. When Parker Haddaway, the mysterious new girl at school offers to help him gain fame and his girlfriend back, Edwin is cautious and hesitates, but finally relents. Together, in pretense of a history assignment, they break out Garland Lenox, a World-War II veteran, from his nursing home and the three of them fly to Paris in search of Garland’s long lost love.<br/><br/>At first, I got the cliché mysterious-new-girl-at-school-and-the-boy-protagonist vibes, but soon the story took a round-about turn. Ever since Garland’s character made the entry, there was no turning back. He’s hilarious, and Parker and Edwin are no less. The characters have amazing chemistry and are well-developed. I loved all the descriptions about Paris and the way the author incorporated stories from World War II. Never would I have thought history could be this hilariously told. Chad’s writing is definitely one of the best things about this book – he has a distinctive humorous tone. While at first the brief one line summary at the top of each chapter felt like they’d spoil the fun, I later found myself actually looking forward to them. It’s a unique idea and it worked. <br/><br/>All in all, I loved how this book is different from the other YA books, especially that ending. I’m so happy it ended the way it did. It also has a slight hinting at a sequel, and if it comes, I’d be first in queue to read it!",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I guess I expected more.<br/><br/>This is my third continuos Jane Austen book and I have to admit, I'm a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>The Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne both didn't hold my affection. I thought Elinor was a bit haughty, arrogant and conceited, and while I admired Marianne's outgoing attitude, I thought she was too prudent most of the times, very unamiable and always too stuck up on Willoughby to actually show any development of character. As for the men, Austen tried making Edward Ferrars a bit too mysterious and kinda failed to make him anything else. Willoughby, on the other hand, undergoes a sudden character change that was almost impossible to comprehend. Colonel Brandon had a lot going for him, but in the end, he just became a side-character who didn't have enough of a role unless he was required to further the plot. My only favorites were Mrs. Jennings and occasionally Sir John.<br/><br/>We all know Austen did better with Pride and Prejudice. I kind of guessed how the book would end because I know Austen's style and she always manages to satisfy me with her pairings. Since this book came before P&P, I think I can see traces of making of the amazing characterization of Elizabeth and Darcy in Elinor and Edward. But here, the story was just a bit too dragged most of the times for me to completely enjoy it.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It wasn't as good as THUG (which wasn't really good for me either) and not as bad as the latter. <br/><br/>Eran and his mom find themselves the center of media attention after a protest led by Eran turns awry. They are both Israeli-Americans living in Texas. He finds out about his dad from the media and internet, while all these years his mother had refused to tell him anything about his ancestry. His friends' support are a relief, and so is going to the synagogue with his mom, even though both of them are not believers. This is the story of him trying to make place for himself among people who insists it is not. The book also focuses on Eran's anger management issues and how he learns to deal with them. <br/><br/>Despite such promising themes being tackled in a very upfront way, the book never roused me emotionally. More than half of the book was boring - the writing is unnecessarily dragged, there is too much descriptions, and the sudden switching of character povs made it difficult to follow. I couldn't empathize with any of the characters and I spent more than half the book hating Eran. I might have skimmed some paragraphs because IT. WAS. BORING. <br/><br/>The ending was really good, even though nothing of real significance happened. The story lacks a definite direction, but the character growth is obvious. I also liked how the anger-management issue was resolved in the end. I thought the Jewish-Israeli representation would be good, but unfortunately, I'm no more knowledgeable on Jews now compared to me before reading this book. <br/><br/><b>2.5/5 stars</b> <br/><br/><i>Many thanks to netgalley and the publisher for providing me an arc in exchange of my honest opinions</i>",,June 27,1,,,0,,,,,

This book!! There’s everything to love and everything to hate in this book. It gives you all the emotions. And I daresay, even if you don’t like the book, it’s going to give you a delightfully painful read all the same. <br/><br/>Now, coming to the story, this book is set in the early 19th century, the period of the civil war in the country of Georgia. Scarlett O’Hara, the eldest daughter of Gerald O’Hara who prides herself to be the belle of the county, the apple of her father’s eyes, the pride of Tara – her home. <br/><br/>The book follows her through the war, through her fall and rise, her unwavering love for Ashley Wilkes, an honorable man who refuses to marry her despite his confession that he loves her. Then there comes Melanie Hamilton, who marries Ashley. She is the epitome of kindness, gentility and everything good. There is Charles and Frank who comes in and out of Scarlett’s life, there is the ‘scalawag’ Rhett Butler.<br/><br/>I must say, as I started the book, I had this notion that Scarlett O’Hara wasn’t going to be a lovable protagonist but she was interesting all the same. She did everything with selfish intentions which would earn the loathe of even the most selfish people. But sometimes, I loved her for she was so unintentionally good, like that time when she risked her life for her family, to protect her home. She loved her home so much, and you love her for it. I loved it that Scarlett O’Hara, the brave lady, had a weakness, had a fear and she did everything in her might to keep the fear at bay. I hated how she seemed to be so devoted to Ashley, so blind to the love and affection of others, so heartless to play with the emotions of other men who fell in her charms. But in the end, we realize Scarlett for who she really is, and we come to love and hate her at the same time. She had all my pity in the end.<br/><br/>Rhett Butler was one person whom I liked for his mind and way of thinking. He isn’t good, he’s too bad actually. But he had such a loving, compassionate mind sometimes that you can’t help falling for him. If it weren’t for his ‘carnal lust’ as he puts it, he would have been any girl’s dream man. And about Melanie and Ellen O’Hara, These two women are the strength of all those surrounding them, the powerhouse of love and goodness, and I also must say that Melanie is far better in that conduct than Ellen. <br/><br/>In short, this book has everything; it covers every aspect of life and emotions, makes you cry hard, and gets you thinking in ways you never had thought before. This is a powerful book, life-changing kind, if I may say so. I loved the ending, the uncertainty in it, a feeling of completeness which kept you longing for more. I took about two months to complete this book, but honestly, I devoured every bit of it and I’m really sorry I could cry that there isn’t more of Margaret Mitchell to occupy the emptiness of mind created by finishing her debut book. (I'd really love to have a sequel, but I wont read the unofficial ones like Scarlett or Rhett Butler's people for it isn't by Mitchell so it's not going to be as good. And if She says she doesn't know what happens to Scarlett, Oh! well I wouldn't bother then! )",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Now the voices are loud, almost as loud as your mother as she calls you down for dinner for the third time. You know it’s the third time even though you don’t remember hearing the first two times. Even though you don’t even remember going up to your room.”  </b></i></blockquote>                <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <br/>This book did to me what no other book has. I can’t really explain. I had an intense head-ache while reading it. I began to see things that weren’t there. The only time I had hallucinations was this one time when I was fifteen and sick. I’d stayed awake all night staring at the dark ceiling, feeling that the ceiling fan was dropping monsters at me, the room was trying to shrink into me, that I was falling into an abyss I couldn’t escape from. I might have puked a few times that night. <u>I can’t begin to imagine what it would be like to live like that <b><i>all the time</i></b></u>. I experienced it now. <b>I deeply resonated with Caden Bosch and his thoughts. </B>I had to stop reading at times, scared to continue, thinking that maybe I’m becoming schizophrenic myself. I felt like I was floating an inch from the ground, like I had lost all purpose. I honestly couldn’t sleep well at all.<b> That is how deep and intensely vivid Shusterman’s writing is.</b> It speaks directly to your brain. <b>It consumes you in whole</b>.<br/><br/>That was mostly for the first half of the book. The second half sometimes felt dragged on. I particularly didn’t enjoy the ship scenes much. Mostly because I was confused on what was going on. <br/><br/><b>But then, it becomes all too clear.</b><br/><br/>I teared up at times. <br/><br/>I related to Caden. <br/><br/>I became scared. <br/><br/>I worried.<br/><br/><b>I even thought of DNFing the book just to end turmoil it was putting me through.</b> <br/><br/><u>But in the end, I just marveled at how deeply and intensely this book affected me. </u><br/><br/><b><i><blockquote> “And that knowledge is so magnificent you can’t hold it in, and it drives you to share it – but you don’t have the words to describe it, and without the words, without a way to share the feeling, it breaks you, because your mind just isn’t large enough to hold what you’ve tried to fit into it…”</b></i></blockquote><br/><br/>Please people, <b>GO AND READ THIS BOOK. </b>It is going to change your perspective on life, and you’ll never read a mental-illness rep the same way ever again.

I don’t love the series but seeing them in a book makes me googly-eyed.<br/>•	And all the love for Prisoner of Azkaban and books and reading!!!!!!<br/>•	All the places these kids travel aaarrggghh<br/>•	I was travelgasming the whole time.<br/>•	And bookgasming<br/>•	Relatable parent-kid banters<br/>•	I just loved how they relived the entire thing and lived it brilliantly,<br/>•	The ending was so satisfactory<br/><br/><u><b> What’s not to love – </b></u><br/>•	There were some unrealistic moments<br/>•	Like, why don’t these kids eat much?<br/>•	And where do they get all the money? <br/>•	I mean, they take international trips every weekend<br/>•	That shit is goddamn expensive and these are kids!! (20 yo’s yeah, but kids -_- )<br/>•	Pilot has the personality of my left foot<br/>•	That’s literally minus hundred<br/>•	It improves in the second half though<br/>•	Instalove<br/>•	And Cheating<br/>•	These couples don’t talk about anything real<br/>•	And many unnatural happenings went unexplained.<br/>•	The first-half Shane and second-half Shane were totally different people<br/>•	The red-headed woman has some explaining to do<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed reading the book and it was the most fun I had in a YA book in recent times. Not your typical teenager plot, but yeah the same old insta-lovey, perfect-cute-looking-boy-who-loves-you-back kinda romance. Looking up Christine makes me realize Shane and Christine are literally the same people, but since I knew Shane first, it wasn’t a problem for me. Do give it a read and keep an open mind while you do. You’re in for some fun. Oh, and obviously, I bet you’ll finish it off with a Shawarma!",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I always used to think why immigrants weren't keen on knowing their culture and homeland, but this book changed my entire perception on that topic. The generation gap and the problems arising with it has been imaginatively dealt with. I especially loved the story of a bright girl struggling in studies because of her parent's ignorance to buy her glasses. It shows the daily life and simple struggles of people. There are some parts where I felt that the stories were kind of repetitive, but overall, I was very pleased with the array of characters and their varied stories.<br/><br/>The author knows what she is talking about and it reflects in her writing.

Why is this getting interesting NOW?</blockquote><br/><br/><u><b>THE PLOT</b></u>:<br/><br/>Meet the leading trio – Beth, Sarah and Marie. They’ve been friends since high school. Now, in their late forties, they’re still friends and make it a point to dine at each other’s house with their husbands Chris, Tony and Duncan. Things get complicated when a young man named Simon is invited to one of their parties by an oblivious Chris. The woman all fawn over him, and to their pleasure, Simon’s wife had just left him for their neighbor. The husbands do not like the development between Simon and their wives, who all trying petulantly to help him cope with his grief. The sharp turn in their lives post-Simon is portrayed in a witty and humorous manner, with a thrilling end. <br/><br/>Frankly, it took me quite a while to get used to the tone of the novel. <b>There were so many characters introduced at once; the narrative seemed a bit confusing.</b> The characters were annoyingly stupid for their age, especially the ladies. I couldn’t gather whether the author intended for them to be that way, or if they were just <i>that</i> way. Speak of forty year olds seducing a twenty-something by showing cleavage in front of their husbands, and all other flirtatious attempts in a not-so-obvious way.<br/><br/><u><b>THE CHARACTERS</b></u>:<br/><br/><b>All of the characters were stereotyped into one-dimension. </b>They were all walking-talking-acting in a way that said they didn’t know to be anything else. Seriously, it was almost to the point of ridiculousness, the way Chris ALWAYS talked about food and dips, Marie ALWAYS seemed to be thrusting her breasts onto other men and how Beth was ALWAYS the voice of reason, even though she was flawed character herself. Here’s all you need to know about the characters in case you don’t believe me:<br/><br/><u><b>Beth</b></u>: The reasonable, fat old lady with the most loving husband ever.<br/><u><b>Chris</b></u>: His sole purpose in life is to inhale dips and nachos and admire his ‘cuddly’ wife.<br/><u><b>Sarah</b></u>: The supermodel, the beauty who had it all – filthy rich husband, a loving daughter and huge ass home and dresses. <br/><u><b>Tony</b></u>: The curt, arrogant husband. Always showing off his earning and making sure others knew not to meddle with him.<br/><u><b>Marie</b></u>: The fitness freak; the flirt; who seeked everyone else’s attention except for her husband’s.<br/><u><b>Duncan</b></u>: Manager at a call center where he has a slightly awkward situation with his PA. Never bothering to respond to his wife flirting with other men. <br/><u><b>Simon</b></u>: The unintentional guest. Broken-hearted at his wife’s affair. Seeking solace from married woman nearly as old as his mum.<br/><u><b>Candice</b></u>: The passionate sex-seeker. Duncan’s employee. Her only purpose in life, according to the other ladies, is to ‘sleep with everybody’.<br/><br/><b>Another thing that bothered me a lot was how each of the characters treated each other.</b> There was little to no compassion, no actual friendship, no reason why they’ve been doing their dinner parties for so long since none of them enjoyed it at all (except of Chris of course. He can never NOT enjoy food). And <b>the way they took control of other people’s life, destroyed other’s marriages and said incredibly mean things about them </b>– it was baffling. Are all adults this way? I don’t aspire to grow up anymore. <br/><br/>The ending was the only thing that makes me not one-star this book. It was interesting and unexpected, although a little too convenient. But I didn’t like how Marie and Candice were dismissed altogether from the epilogue.<br/><br/>I did not like any of the characters, nor did I laugh or cry at the moments that called for it. But somehow I was rather satisfied with the ending, considering it took me a while to reach there. <br/>I haven’t read a book like this one, nor do I know who might enjoy this. <b>Pick it up if you’re in for some humorous quirky characters and writing that tries in vain to be sarcastic.</b><br/><br/>P.S. HALF-STARS FOR THE DIP RECIPE!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

He/she was depressed and thought that their life was worthless. I knew how a wrong word from my side would result in something tragic, so I didn’t say much. If you’re depressed and you’re reading this, please know that you’re valued. <br/><b>YOUR EXISTENCE MATTERS.</b><br/><br/>Which brings me back to this book. <br/><br/>Falling Into Place by Amy Zhang is about Liz Emerson and how she decided to end her life. Liz is a fundamentally awful person. At her school in Meridian High, she is the popular mean girl, the bully, the star soccer player. Together with her best friends Julia and Kennie, Liz has done all that she could to maintain that image, to tell the world that they don’t care, to destroy anyone who came in their way. But inside, Liz is shattered. Inside, Liz is breaking. And no one knows. So one evening, Liz puts Newton’s laws into practice and runs her Mercedes off the road. And now the only thing keeping her alive is the machine moving her lungs. <br/>And yet, the question remains: <b>Why Didn’t Anybody Know? </b><br/><br/><b><i><blockquote>“They were catalysts, the fingers that tipped the first domino. They started things that grew into nothing things that were much greater than themselves. A touch, a nudge in the wrong direction, and everyone fell down.” </b></i></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>This book deserves a million accolades for being the best debut ever. <b>I can’t stress this enough; Amy Zhang’s writing is absolutely beautiful.</b> Everything about this book – <b>the mysterious narrator, the perfectly flawed characters, the alternating timelines, the writing, the sheer brilliance of the plot execution </b>– is done with utmost care. I can’t believe Zhang was just seventeen when she wrote this book. The emotional intelligence required to grasp this level of understanding of the human psyche is far more than what that age calls for. But Zhang has done it, and the result is beautiful. <br/><br/><b>Liz is a very unlikeable protagonist. </b>What struck me the most about her character was how we each have a part of Liz in us. She craves for the sky; the shard of light through the network of clouds. She bullies people, says mean things she doesn’t mean. In short, she lives up to the expectations of the people, which is, to be a bitch. Like I said, she isn’t likeable.<b> But very rarely have I come across a realistic YA novel which portrays a flawed character so well and manages to gather sympathy. </b>There is so much character development in this book, you’re going to worry Liz is real and dying. I wonder what the author went through to come up with a character like Liz.<br/><br/>Julia and Kennie play an equally important role in the book. Their characters never swap places, you never mix them up. Their backstories are aligned perfectly so. <br/><br/>I related to Julia the most, who is the sensible and rational one among the three. But she is also the one whose life Liz destroyed. When Julia is ready to forgive, Liz is not there to listen. Kennie on the other hand, is like the Gretchen in the Mean Girls trio. She’s famous and rich, likes the attention she gets, but evidently has secrets of her own too. <br/>I also loved Liam Oliver, the fourth main character. Very little is revealed about him and yet his role has a great impact.<br/><br/><b>The friendship and the bonding between the three girls in spite of everything else surprised me. There is also so much about family and relationships and broken people. </b>Monica Emerson’s incomprehensible feelings become real and raw in front of us. Julia and Kennie’s grief over their best friend’s accident is shaking. The immense shock of discovering your crush broken and shattered on the road is explored through Liam’s point of view. Within these pages, there are so many subtle observations on human emotions, the characters, and life in general, that made me pause a moment to just sit back and admire the page. <br/><br/>I’ve seen many people being mad at this book because seeking help for mental illness is portrayed negatively. Liz goes to her guidance counselor as a last resort, but somehow ends up getting guiltier and depressed than before. I think that was an important part. It’s not at all easy to open up to somebody – even a guidance counselor – when all they know about you is from your reputation of being a bitch. It showed me how there’s a little good left in everybody, how it must take a right person for them to show their true side. Liz’s character taught me a lot. <br/><br/>Even now, if you are having second thoughts about reading this book, what can I say, your loss. If not for the very common trope of depression and suicide among high-school students, read it for the writing. I’m sure Amy Zhang won’t disappoint you. But be aware that the characters are here to teach you something, not to make you like them.<br/><br/><b><i><blockquote>“She is human and bound by the same laws of nature—gravity, in particular—as everyone else.

Not much, I agree. As a 14 yo, I did nothing but watch soaps and quarrel with my siblings. I know, priorities  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/><br/>This book is a historical fiction. Let me tell you this - Jangir knows his history and technology. Besides, this book was written way better than many other Indian books I know. Now that’s some serious praise.<br/><br/>Survival Sandstorm is narrated through various viewpoints. Our main character is Ivsker Vodkech, who worked as an air pilot during World War II. He holds the responsibility of transporting three hostages in his plane, to the allies – three hostages who can change the course of the war. Unheeding the warning of a Sandstorm, Ivsker’s plane crashes in the dry heat of Sahara desert, where they are captured by slavers. This book is about Ivsker’s attempt to survive, and at the same time, carry on a responsibility that might change the world. <br/><br/><b>The book needs some getting used to.</b> Starting off with the prologue, there are random historical facts thrown into our faces, which I can’t really credit to be true, since I never really listened to history classes. The book is narrated in varying points of views, from Ivsker’s, from the slavers, to even the hostages. Undoubtedly, my favorite character was Ivsker, because none of the other characters were fleshed out enough. Sometimes, the different narratives got a bit confusing, since we’d suddenly move from one person to some other character who has not even been introduced. But otherwise, the gist of the story remained intact. The writing was heartfelt. There were a few cases of bad editing my hungry eyes couldn’t ignore, but otherwise everything went well. <br/><b>Emotions were felt, a story was understood, and anticipation was built with that HUGE CLIFFHANGER of an ending.  </b>Like, literally, nothing about the story is resolved?? What happened? Who died? Who survived?? NOTHING. But I guess, I shouldn’t have expected much since the book is way too short. I still took some time to read the book tho, not its fault, really.<br/><br/><b>Overall, </b> this is a book that requires some patience. If you know a little about rifles and different types of guns, I bet you’d love Jangir’s enthusiasm. If you love historical fiction, you’ love this book too. It isn’t deep or intense or heart-wrenching, but it definitely delivers.<br/><br/><b>3.5/5 stars</b><br/><br/>P.S I bet you can’t tell the book is written by a boy who is 12 going on 14.<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Reading smut can be effective sometimes. <br/><br/><b>Stella Lane</b> is autistic and successful. She’s making loads of money as an econometrist. But social interaction is not her greatest strength. She decides to learn the right way of pleasing a man, and for this, she hires an escort – Michael. <b>Michael Larsen</b> stays with his mom and five sisters at their house, where he works day-time as a tailor, and Friday nights as a male escort. Stella was just another client to him at first, but her different approach towards him made her interesting. Their intercourse was nothing like he ever had before. Helping her to overcome her anxiety issues, Michael and Stella become closer. But they don’t fit, and Michael knows that. How would he get past her when all this fake-dating is over? <br/><br/>Now, when you write negative reviews, the best way to start is by listing out the good stuff. So here goes – <br/><blockquote><br/>•	<b>THE AUTISM REP</b>. Stella has Asperger’s syndrome and <b>I think it was the best rep ever. </b>No, I have no idea how autistic people think, or what they go through, but Stella’s character felt real and relatable in a touching way. Not to mention, I could think of a few people like Stella, and that made it even more personal for me, I might’ve cried a bit. Plus, the anxiety and nervousness of Stella’s character were amazingly done, I could see myself in her. AND DI YOU KNOW THAT HELEN HOANG GOT DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM WHILE RESEARCHING FOR THIS BOOK? How cool is that?!<br/><br/>•	<b>THE DIVERSITY!!</b>. Michael is of a mixed Vietnamese and Swedish heritage which is lovely. And all the food talk in his house, all those lovely sisters of his and his house, in general, was so lively and lovable, I just loved those parts. <br/><br/>•	<b>Janet</b>. She’s Michael little sister and she’s my favorite character to feature in this book. Oh, the book doesn’t deserve her with the very little role she has in it though,.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Apparently, the good things end there. To be honest, there aren’t many parts of this book I remember, to even write good stuff about. Besides the lack of actual romantic development, THIS BOOK WAS FULL OF CLICHES. <br/><br/><b>*drumrolls*</b> for a tiny peek into Michael and Stella’s sex life <br/><br/><blockquote><i> “She bought their lips together and kissed him like he was oxygen and she was short on air;” </i></blockquote><br/><br/>I’ve seen that line in every single romance novel I’ve read, and I don’t even read many romances. <br/><br/><blockquote><i> “He surrounded her with his arms and aligned their hips, her softness to his hardness.” </blockquote></i><br/><br/>Softness? Hardness? Are you fucking kidding me? <br/><br/><blockquote><i> “Liquid aching pervaded her limbs.” </blockquote></i><br/>How touching -.- <br/><br/><b>There was little story and too much sex, it overwhelms the whole plot. </b>I mean, yeah, it’s to be expected when the book is about a prostitute and his client, but, like, ALL?? THE?? TIME?? And the sex was err.., yeah, HOT. Like, the first time it happens in the book can be compared to having sex for the first time. It’s kinda awkward and painful, but hot and sensual all the same. And then it soon gets <b>BORING. </b><u>Hoang couldn’t even come up with new ways to describe people having sex. </u>That sounds weird, but then again, how do you write erotica? Uh, also, is it weird that in my mind they looked like animals while they were at it? I mean, IT WAS WILD. Omg what am I saying. Bye.<br/><br/>My biggest problem though? <b>Michael</b> I don’t understand how the fuck women can swoon over him because he’s so damn demanding all the time. Yeah, he always considers Stella’s anxiety issues first, but not ALL THE TIME. Sometimes, she’s not ready and her anxiety is at its worst, but then he’s like “Come on Stella! It’d be alright” and she’s like, “Okay then,.. maybe I’ll try”. <b>He’s pushy and demanding.</b> Outside the bed, he’s condescending. Every damn time he refers to her as “My Stella”, which is fucking egotistical and wrong in so many fucking ways. And all the time, he’s afraid to confront her parents <b>because they’re rich.</b> He doesn’t want to be with Stella because she’s rich, has a well-earning job and lives in an apartment the size of his whole house. He doesn’t even consider telling her he likes her, because she’s fucking rich! Fuck Michael, you can fuck her and live with her and act possessive like she’s your fucking right hand, but you can’t get over yourself and just tell her SHE’S AMAZING, AND BEAUTIFUL AND DESERVEDLY RICH??? He does nothing of the sort. He just thinks to himself she’s beautiful, but he can’t be bothered to appreciate her for her well-being because HE HAS AN EGO THE SIZE OF HIS FUCKING PENIS!! (WHICH IS GIGANTIC ACCORDING TO STELLA, btw)<br/><br/>And the way Stella swoons over Michael every single time shatters every single feministic view I’ve ever heard of. Like, on one hand, the book looks feministic with the female lead all successful and dependent. But in reality, it’s quite anti-feministic in the way it portrays Stella as Michael’s possession. I don’t understand how that can be any good. <br/><br/><b>THAT GODDAMN ENDING</b> was frustratingly disappointing. HIGHLY PREDICTABLE. I knew from the very first page how this was going to end. <u>It happened the exact same way I imagined it would.</u> I at least hoped there would be something good to come out of it, but Nah. <b>The misunderstanding had no foundation.</b> Every time they’re together, they look at each other like they’re food themselves, and they even acknowledge that they like each other, but they still had to drift apart because they thought the other person didn’t like them enough?! It was too obvious to happen that way. But duh, <b>how can you doubt a romance when there wasn’t any romance developed in the first place?? </b> I didn’t see any reason why they loved each other. The characters were generic stereotypes, with no real personality. But in the end, they were hopelessly in love with each other because they had good sex? How the fuck does that work? They never talked, they knew very little about each other. All they ever did together was have goddamn sex, but in the end, they can’t live without each other? Sorry, but I DON’T BUY THAT. <br/><br/>In the end, <b>This was just another overhyped book. </B>I understand the reason for the hype though – an autistic, self-dependent female lead isn’t that common in literature. Add to that some sex? An instant hit. Not for me though. Maybe if you enjoy some smut, this book should be your next pick. If you give a little shit about the plot and solid development between characters, ignore it like I should have done.<br/><br/><br/>* ----- * ----- * ----- * ----- *<br/><br/><br/><b>INITIAL REVIEW - </B><br/><br/>I think I lost my virginity to this book.<br/><br/>Also, fuck everybody who categorized this as romance and not erotica. This is clearly smut. They have sex for 75% of the book. Full blown details of gasms and Js.

But musicians paint their pictures on silence.” </b></i></blockquote><br/><br/><b>Pippa Wyndham</b> is a top cellist, first chair at her school. She has her life planned out – get into Goddards – the top music school in the country, graduate and find her way to the New York Philharmonic. She has had a crush on Noah, her twin brother’s best friend, since forever. When he starts noticing her, she thinks her life is perfect. <br/><br/><b>Enter Declan.</b> <br/><br/>Declan is a cellist, just like Pippa. He moved from New York in his final year and has got on Pippa’s nerves ever since she found out he might be her competition. When their music teacher pairs them together to practice for a duet, falling for Declan is the last thing on her mind. But soon, she is unable to deny her growing feelings towards Declan, her sworn enemy. And there’s a possibility that Declan likes her back.. But she can’t fall for him or her dreams would all come crashing down. <br/><br/><b>Each chapter begins with a quote on music, </b>which were absolutely amazing and I loved such warm-up reminders of how awesome music is.<br/><br/>First things first, <b>Albright’s writing is amazing.</b> I don’t know what I expected, but this was perfect. Her tone is smooth and straight forward and touching at the right places. It kept me reading, and frankly, even if the plot felt dragged out a bit at places, that’s what kept me reading. I’d certainly check out more of her books. <br/><br/><b>The focus on music</b> was an enchanting experience. But I wish it focused more on describing the feel of the music rather than just about how Pippa felt. I know it wasn’t songs and there weren’t lyrics, but I wanted <i>more</i>.<br/><br/>I love Pippa and Declan, though not necessarily together. Pippa’s voice was immature at times, but her character growth is undeniable. It had a certain nostalgic feeling in it, which made me reminisce my school days. Few high school books have achieved that level of impact, and this one is certainly one among them. And the way this book tackled the stereotypes of girls always vying for attention from boys is worth a mention. <br/><br/><blockquote><b><i> “You know, despite what you may think, having a boyfriend isn’t high on my list of things to do. I get that it’s a common stereotype for girls, but I think if you actually paid attention, you’d find far fewer of us actually care about it as much as you think we do.” </b></i></blockquote><br/><br/>I wasn’t a fan of Noah, nor of Quinn. She was a selfish friend, and thought about no one else but herself. Philip was barely present, considering he was Pippa’s twin. My favorite character might be Pippa’s mother. She was the best. A great listener, supporting Pippa through thick and thin, with the right advice at the right time – I just loved her! <br/><br/><b>The romance</b> was one of the best I’ve encountered in YA, but only in the beginning. It wasn’t insta-love by any means, but rather the enemies-to-lovers kinda romance. There is a big love pentagon which was actually executed well. The only thing I felt lacking was the communication between Pippa and Declan. Every single time they are together, they’re either kissing or she’s thinking of kissing him. It didn’t feel right. You can only read so much about fireworks exploding in your stomach each time the love interests look at you.<br/><br/><b>Overall, this was a great read.</b> If you’re looking for some nostalgic, light read with mild friendship and family dynamics, then this book is for you.<br/><br/><br/><blockquote><i> My first eARC from netgalley!

Where are the books written by people from these nations? WHY AREN’T BOOKS SET IN THESE BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL LANDS? Why are people so interested in America and only what happens to people over there? I’m not blaming America. It’s a great nation, and it’s practically ruling the world for a reason. But at least in literature,<b> we need ACTUAL DIVERSITY. </b>Idk, I might sound hypocritical, considering this book is titled ‘American Panda’, but that only enforces my point imo. And FOR THE RECORD, I’m ASIAN.<br/><br/><b>Mei Lu is Taiwanese-American. </b>She was born and bought up in America, but her parents are conservative and traditional in a way that is almost oppressing. She isn’t allowed to date, her parents have already planned out her future, right from her career to her future-husband and children. Mei has never questioned her parents’ upbringing, until they disowned her brother Xing for falling in love with a girl who couldn’t bear them grandchildren, even though she was Taiwanese. Being a Doctor was never what she wanted for herself. <b>Could she convince her parents to let her out of their grasp and follow her dreams? </b><br/><br/><b><u>My Thoughts</u></b><br/><br/>•	<b>THE DIVERSITY.</b> Can you point out a book to me with a Taiwanese protagonist? I loved that part. It was important, AND YET I felt the author could have put in some more of Taiwan rather than just some Mandarin words which I couldn’t pronounce, nor understand. For instance, Mei mentions that she was bought up Buddhist. But there’s no indication how. Same way, Mei was supposedly brilliant. But she’s pretty much clueless all the time. <br/>Also, it is set in MIT. Geddit? UNIVERSITY. Catch.<br/><br/>•	<b>IF ANYBODY IS ASPIRING TO BE A DOCTOR, YOU BETTER NOT READ THIS BOOK</b>. I understand Mei wasn’t cut out to be a doctor, but at least she could’ve emphasized how important the profession actually is. It shows us all the gross aspects of being a med student and eventually a doctor, but where are the better parts? <br/><br/>•	<b>THE REPRESENTATION OF CONSERVATIVE PARENTS.</b> It’s important for the world to see how things work everywhere else in the world. I personally related so much to Mei on the parental front, and it was just so lovely to see myself in a book, to know that there were others who felt the way I did.<br/><br/>•	<b>THE RELATIONSHIPS</B>. Whatever they are, your parents and elders do want the best for you. But outright disrespect towards them is only going to throw them off. I really did not agree with Mei on how she treated her family and elders. She never replied to her mother’s concerned messages or her aunt and granny’s voicemails. Idk, but that’s like teaching your kids to disrespect your elders. There wasn’t any relationship I could relate to, or agree with.<br/><br/>•	<b>THE ROMANCE</b>. It was kinda insta-love and there was no development. Mei goes on and on about how cute and adorable Darren is, but their relationship lacked any depth of emotions. I never once felt any spark, the kisses went right over my head, and the cuddling failed to tingle me.<br/><br/>•	<b>THE WRITING</b>. Although I feel Gloria Chao has real potential, her writing was actually quite simple and bland. It wasn’t the smoothest book I’ve read, and that’s kind of rare in YA literature where you usually fly through the books. It wasn’t the case here.<br/><br/>•	<b>THE ENDING</b>. Disappointing is all I can say. Gloria Chao went the usual way as is for every other YA lit out there. It’s utterly predictable and uninteresting. I can’t believe she had such an important and diverse story to tell and she decided to tell it this way. It basically destroys the purpose of this book and makes it no different than any other YA book.<br/><br/>I had a feeling that I’d fall in love with this book which obviously didn’t happen. One of the reasons for me was<b> how culture is treated here.</b> Mei says she’s not just Taiwanese, but Taiwanese-American.<b> But in the end, she chose to be just American. </b>I want to see a protagonist who values their culture as much as it values them. The culture and traditions might be backward and might seem oppressive, but there are a lot of people who still value them, and value them for a reason. Being American and living in the American-way isn’t going to solve anything. <b>There isn’t just one way to do things. You can embrace your culture and still belong. You can love your ancestors and still see the value of a free lifestyle. The book is set on convincing us that all traditions are bad and forbearing.</b> I hate to see cultures and traditions demeaned this way. <br/><br/><b>In the end, </b>this book is just another book with an MC who categorizes as POC and isn’t happy. There’s a girl trying to follow her dreams, a failed romance, and inevitably predictable ending. You could chose to read this book or not. Either way,<b> I assure you this isn’t the best cultural-PoC representation you’ll find.</b>",,,1,Fans of When Dimple Met Rishi,,0,,,,,

Knives, daggers and swords are Lada’s weapons while brains, words and a charming smile does the work for Radu. Vlad is under the influence of Murad, the ruler of the Ottoman Empire. Vlad, in order to resume his hold on his kingdom, is forced to make a treaty with Murad, with Lada and Radu at stake. They are taken to the Ottoman kingdom as hostages. There, they meet Mehmed, Murad’s third son with whom both of them get attached. Lada trains with the Janissaries, while Radu is compelled by Islam and converts. The complex web of relationships, a failure of the treaty, and a battle for survival all forms the rest of the story. <br/><br/><b>What’s good :-</b><br/><br/>&#x1f449; This book drew me in at the very beginning. Kiersten White has a poetic way of storytelling that is enthralling to say the least. I didn’t feel bored at all through the 500+ pages.<br/><blockquote><i>'…His legs aching every night with the stretching pull of time finally claiming his childhood'</i></blockquote><br/><br/>..,Isn't that beautiful? <br/><br/>&#x1f449; <b>Lada.</b> She is one hell of a heroine. Fierce, brutal, violent, stone-hearted all in the best possible way, wrapped up with her badass attitude makes her an unforgettable character. <blockquote><i>'Weakness is an irresistible lure'<br/><br/>“On our wedding night,"" she said, ""I will cut out your tongue and swallow it. Then both tongues that spoke our marriage vows will belong to me, and I will be wed only to myself. You will most likely choke to death on your own blood, which will be unfortunate, but I will be both husband and wife and therefore not a widow to be pitied.” </i></blockquote><br/><br/>&#x1f449; <b>Radu.</b> This handsome boy, with equally charming mind makes up for the violent girl his sister is. These two characters form the heart of the story and the journey through their narratives was very enjoyable.<br/><br/>&#x1f449; The way religions are treated, with no actual judgements can’t go unnoticed. White makes sure, she offends no one with her story and she did it well.<br/><br/>&#x1f449; The themes addressed in this story are wide and varied. Religion, relationship, betrayal, LGBTQ+, patriotism, faith and loyalty. The book is actually brutal, doesn’t hold back anything and leaves the reader wide-eyed in wonder at places.<br/><br/><blockquote><i>'The price of living seems to always be death'</blockquote><br/><br/>'Some victories are merely defeat wearing the wrong clothing'</i></blockquote><br/><br/><b>What’s not:-</b><br/><br/>&#x1f449; Mehmed. He is a little hypocrite, who cares for no one but himself, who thirsts for power as if it is his birthright. Even though his actions are justified with inane reasons in the book, I couldn’t bring myself to love him. <br/><br/>&#x1f449; The action, when it came, was all jumbled up. I didn’t get what happened in those few pages and it happened quickly that I didn’t bother to ponder over what happened.<br/><br/>&#x1f449; This might be an unpopular opinion but none of the characters were developed well, except for Radu, maybe, and nothing made me actually <i>feel</i> for them. It was emotionless tbh <br/><br/><b>This book</b> was an painful ride and sometimes boring at parts. The end promised something equally good was on the way. I expected a more <i>emotional</i> read, which wasn’t the case. I liked the book, but it didn’t make me fangirl all over the place.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I have always appreciated Green’s intelligence and understanding of human mind even if I haven’t necessarily loved his books. The level of relatable moments while reading this book was surprising. What cost this book a fifth star, you might ask. Well, it was all the gross moments and profane thoughts in this book which was too much for me. We’ll come to that later.<br/><br/>Margo Roth Spiegelman – This whole book revolves around her, even if it is narrated by another person. Quentin ‘Q’ has had a weird history with Margo, of discovering a dead body in the Central Park while playing when they were nine-year olds. <br/><br/><b><i><blockquote>Margo always loved mysteries. And in everything that came afterward, I could never stop thinking that maybe she loved mysteries so much that she became one.</blockquote></i></b><br/><br/>Nine-years later, after an adventurous reunion-kinda night, Margo Roth Spiegelman disappears. And in her wake, she has left some clues which might lead to her- or maybe just somewhere else, because that was how Margo was.<br/><br/><b><u>What I loved -</b></u><br/><br/>¤▪	As expected, Green’s writing style was spot-on. <b>Crisp and clear, right-to-the-point. </b><br/><br/>¤▪	<b>The characters.</b> Green is one of those writers who can build up a plethora of dynamic, realistic characters, and never knows what to really do with them. But here, he makes it work. The characters steal the show. Margo was the dynamic one. Q, the up-and-coming hero of our story, Ben the dirty one, Radar, the rational one. One of the few times where I could write an endless thesis on the characters and still keep you hooked. <br/><br/>¤▪	<b>Whitman references. Or just every other book and music references. </b>I’ve never read a poetry book, much less a Whitman one. But I might just pick up one right now. Walt Whitman and his poems make up a huge part of the story. Don’t worry. You don’t need to read them to read this book.<br/><br/>¤▪	<b>The plot – </b>its originality, vibrancy, the scavenger hunt.

The way the book tackled suicide and such sensitive issues were really thoughtful.<br/><br/><b><i><blockquote> “What a treacherous thing it is to believe that a person is more than a person.”</blockquote></i></b><br/><br/><br/><b><u>What I didn’t like -</u></b><br/><br/>The sick sense of humor. OMG. This was a big problem. I have heard boys think dirty most of the time, but if this book is an accurate portrayal of their thoughts, I want nothing to do with them. Green can write brilliantly once and move on to say the dirtiest, grossest thing you have ever read, in the next sentence. Okay besides the gross humor, there were also real instances, like, say, peeing in a bottle. But the way it is described would make you want to never pee again. Maybe I’m just naïve and I just haven’t had much experience with gross-reading.<br/> <br/>But - THE. STRUGGLE. WAS.

If you’ve read his other books, you’d know that, <br/><br/><b>*	Aza Holmes = Hazel Grace = Quentin Jacobsen = Miles Halter.</b> They’re the silent, watchful protagonists.<br/><b>*	Daisy Ramirez = Margo Roth Spiegelmen = Alaska Young.</b> They’re the high-spirited, reckless, give-no-shit kinda side characters.

It’s John Green. You don’t get an actual plot. </b>He just sets up a background for him to lay down his thoughts and a bunch of researched, supposedly interesting Wikipedia articles. The fact that I don’t even remember how this book ended - even if it’s been just a day since I finished reading this book - speaks volumes about its plot. <br/><br/>Here’s what you get to see in this book –<br/><br/><blockquote><b>*</b> Ava Holmes has an <u>anxiety disorder.</u> She keeps thinking about germs and the Human Microbiota and the different ways in which she’d get a disease and die. So she tries to prevent them.<br/><b>*</b> Daisy Ramirez is her best-friend who’s poor. She talks all the time and writes fan-fiction. <br/><b>*</b> So naturally, when a news report announces ten thousand dollars for information on a missing billionaire Davis Pickett, Daisy HAS to have the money. <br/><br/><b>*</b> She drags Ava along for the investigation, as if she can’t think for herself. <br/><b>*</b> Davis Pickett’s son Davis Pickett Jr. had been a childhood friend of Ava’s. So when they turn up at his mansion, naturally they reconcile and old feelings spring back.<br/><b>*</b> The usual - romance develops, Pickett is found. They get their money. Everybody moves on.<br/> <br/>There’s nothing unique, or even remotely interesting. You’d think that this search-for-a-missing-person subplot might actually fuel up the story, but no, it takes up little part of it, and there’s nothing to it at all.<br/><br/><blockquote><b>&#x1f422;	<u>THE WRITING</b></blockquote><br/><br/>Like always, John Green’s writing is impeccable. How this guy manages to pen down such twisted, true-to-the-core sentences dripping with wisdom, sarcasm and sometimes, humor, is beyond me. He is a pro at capturing the innermost wailings of a human mind and putting them in front of you. I can say, <b>you’d never get bored of reading his books. </b><br/><br/><b><i><blockquote> “The worst part of being truly alone is you think about all the times you wished that everyone would just leave you be. Then they do, and you are left being, and you turn out to be terrible company.” </b></i></blockquote><br/><br/>^^ that’s my new favorite quote fyi<br/><br/><blockquote><b>&#x1f422;	<u>THE CHARACTERS</B></U></BLOCKQUOTE><br/><br/>•	<b>Ava Holmes</b>. I could really connect with Ava’s character. Like, her thought process was very similar to mine. Apparently she’s suffering from a mental illness, and that’s what makes her think so much so shouldn’t I be worried I’m suffering from the same illness too? Umm.. no. Her character didn’t feel real in a way characters are meant to be. She was just her mental illness and nothing more. Ask me to describe Ava. I’ve no idea. Because<b> Green forgot to describe her character while fervently trying to make her convincingly mentally ill, which just didn’t work? </b>And she’s like every other Green character – always tailing behind the energetic, enthusiastic best friend (Daisy in this case), with no personality of her own.<br/><br/>•	<b>Daisy Ramirez</b>. This is the girl with whom we’re supposed to fall in love with. She talks too much and basically drags Ava along with her everywhere she goes. I did like her passion for fan-fiction and I did think she was a good friend. But molding her to fill in the stereotypes of poor, working, passionate best friend was just discouraging. Green needs to work on creating better, diverse characters.<br/><br/>•	<b>Davis Pickett</b>. He was basically the Augustus Waters to the Hazel Grace that is Ava Holmes. He speaks in sentences that would probably take him minutes to complete. He talks in indecipherable metaphors. And he is… nothing else. I can’t describe him either. He lacks character, personality and any trait that would qualify him to be a realistic teenage character. I loved his bond with his brother, though. But even that wasn’t convincing enough, because he speaks with his brother for, like, twice in the whole book.<br/><br/><b><BLOCKQUOTE>&#x1f422;    	 <u>THE MENTAL ILLNESS REP</BLOCKQUOTE></U></B><br/><br/>Ava Holmes has an anxiety disorder, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. But neither of them is mentioned clearly. You see, that’s the biggest mistake you can do with a mental rep - <b>Not acknowledging the mental illness.</b> It felt to me like Ava’s mental illness was used an excuse for Green to churn out metaphors and philosophical ideologies on spirals and what-not. Her thoughts felt <i>normal</i>. Not that I want to degrade mentally ill people, but there’s no clear indication of Ava’s mental illness and the representation feels false. And Ava’s character felt similar to Davis’s, who wasn’t even mentally ill. Another thing was that, <b>Ava was just her mental illness and nothing more.</b> She has no other personality, no other characteristic trait that’s not because of her illness. She’s always detached and there’s no sign she even has a life beyond her illness. But I appreciate the author’s attempt to show us the inner twirling spiral of a mentally-ill person’s mind. Like this – <br/><br/><b><i><blockquote>“Imagine you’re trying to find someone, or even you’re trying to find yourself, but you have no senses, no way to know where the walls are, which way is forward or backward, what is water and what is air. You’re senseless and shapeless—you feel like you can only describe what you are by identifying what you’re not, and you’re floating around in a body with no control. You don’t get to decide who you like or where you live or when you eat or what you fear. You’re just stuck in there, totally alone, in this darkness. That’s scary. This,” I said, and turned on the flashlight. “This is control. This is power. There may be rats and spiders and whatever the hell. But we shine the light on them, not the other way around. We know where the walls are, which way is in and which way is out. This,” I said, turning off my light again, “is what I feel like when I’m scared. This”—I turned the flashlight back on—“is a walk in the fucking park.” </b></i><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>But the spiral itself? I’m not sure Green managed to capture the feelings correctly. Rather, he just put down <i>his</i> thoughts on it,<i> his</i> feeling and ideas about how a mentally ill person might think. And that’s not enough. That’s definitely not enough. <br/><br/>I also admired the role of the counselor in this book. Ava seeks help from Dr. Karen Singh - a psychologist - for her anxiety. And the interaction between Ava and Dr. Singh was the best ever Doctor-patient interaction I’ve read in mental-illness reps. We needed THAT reminder that seeking help for your mental illness actually does HELP, it works, it makes you feel less alone. That’s encouraging and would actually be useful, unlike the rest of this book. <br/><br/><b><BLOCKQUOTE>&#x1f422;		<u>THE ROMANCE</u></b></blockquote><br/><br/>It didn’t feel like a romance, if it was meant to be one. There was zero development, absolutely no chemistry and not even a single spark of realism. All the couple ever did was talk nonsensically, plow out philosophical ramblings, lie on the ground and watch stars. While the last part might sound amazing, it really wasn’t. I felt bored. But at least John Green refrained from romanticizing mental illness, and that itself is applause-worthy in my opinion.  <br/><br/><b><BLOCKQUOTE>		<u>VERDICT</b></u></BLOCKQUOTE>	<br/><br/>In my overall opinion, this isn’t John Green’s best work, and neither does he HAVE a best work smh. My favorite so far has been Paper Towns, but even that isn’t spectacular. The guy has got some imagination and a huge ounce of creativity but he can’t weave a good story for anybody’s sake. Read this if you’re a John Green fan. Otherwise, it’d be a hit-or-miss kinda book.<br/><br/><b>2.5/5 stars</b>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I refuse to believe J.K Rowling allowed the authors to create such an idiotic story and sell them. I mean, I’m pretty sure you lack no money, <u>what the fuck was the need for this book?</u> And if you had to, why couldn’t you have come up with something original and creative, some solid plot, rather than just feeding snippets of nostalgia to your fans? <br/><br/>I’ll explain – <b>the weakest plot in the Harry Potter books was the time-turner thing. </b>So the authors decided to use it again, and weave an unbelievably ridiculous story around it, which isn’t even original – it’s basically a rip-off from Rowling’s own books. FYI, most of this book is flashbacks – so much time spent in revisiting the Triwizard Tournament, Harry’s tormented days at the Dursley’s and the historical day of Halloween at Godric’s Hollow when Voldemort fell. I think the authors were aware of the immense nostalgia surrounding this series, so they hit right on the spot. And to be frank, it actually works – I did find myself enjoying meeting our Golden Trio after a long time, seeing them all grown-up and all, but even then, it’s all fucked up. And the magic was lost – there wasn’t an instance of real friendship or perseverance in the bond of the Golden Trio this time. <br/><br/>Harry and every other adult acted incredibly stupid, they’ve not matured an inch.<b> All the characters are the most stereotypical version of themselves. </b>Harry is a struggling father - striving to get close to his son - a Ministry official who can’t even be bothered to read important ministry files. Hermione is the overworking Minister for Magic. Ron could as well have been a buffoon. I rather didn’t like Albus Potter, he is just a meaner version of young Harry with very little temper. The only well-developed characters here were Scorpius and Draco Malfoy, and boy, I’ve started loving Draco much more now than I ever did. <br/><br/>Also, <b>WHERE IS SIRIUS BLACK???!!!! WHY ISN'T HE EVEN MENTIONED ONCE??!!! -.-</b><br/><br/>The actual problem with this book though, is obviously the weak plot. There’s zero-percent originality to it. And omfg, if you didn’t know from the blurb, VOLDEMORT HAS A CHILD. <br/><br/>Oh yes. <br/><br/><u>VOLDEMORT HAD SEX.</u><br/><br/>I mean, can you imagine? <b>Voldemort shedding his clothes and getting naked, and fucking a woman?</b> It wasn’t even rape (could he even do that?), it was SEX, as in sex with consent.  <br/><br/>V-O-L-D-E-M-O-R-T - The same Dark Lord who didn’t know the first thing about love and care, who wouldn’t ever give an actual fuck to anybody close to him, fucked <spoiler>BELLATRIX LESTRAGE</spoiler> during the skirmish at Malfoy Manor, and nobody knew the mother was pregnant with Voldemort’s child. <b><u>That is insane and all level of crazy. </u></b>I can’t for a moment believe Voldemort could gather affection for a child, albeit his own. <b>The whole of Harry Potter series is built on the foundation of love, of Voldemort’s inability to understand love and affection, and Rowling and her pals had to hammer it down with this stupid, stupid book.</b> Besides that, the number of times the time-turner is used in this book is just baffling, and during all those time-travelling we get to see the what-ifs, what-would-have-happened-if-Harry-died, etc, I can’t think of any other reasons for such a plot, other than to feed the hungry fans - such as myself - with impossibly wild events from their favorite fan-fiction, <u>and to prove that Albus Potter has got absolutely no brain cells in his chummy little head. </u><br/><br/>As for the script part, I didn’t have much issue with it. It was easy to read, and humorous at times too. But the dialogues are unrealistic in the sense that they’re written just to get a laugh from the audience - there’s no way real people speak that way in real life. <br/><br/>Ooh, I almost forgot – what was up with the Trolley-witch?? It was effin ridiculous. That poor woman has been serving the kids in the Hogwarts Express for, like, 99 years, but when Albus and Scorpius comes around, she somehow turns into this evil witch we see in fairy tales.???!!<br/> <br/>The only good thing about his book was that it got me out of my slump.<br/><br/>Oh, and it got over quickly.<br/><br/><b>For me, Harry’s story ended with The Deathly Hallows and the HEA epilogue. </b>This book is a reminder that you shouldn’t try to mess with characters and stories that aren’t your own – nobody can imitate J.K Rowling’s writing prowess, even if Rowling wants to let you.<br/><br/>-----------------<br/><br/><b>2.5/5 stars just for the enjoyment factor</b>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Hobbits are supposedly bigger than dwarves, but like, what’s the deal? <b>Instead of describing everything else, Tolkien could have tried to describe his creatures and their history a bit better,</b> tried to give his readers something to imagine. While others say his world-building is amazing, I couldn’t get it at all. <b>And the history lessons, when it came, was like information dump and went straight over my head. </b>It was easy to fall asleep - after all, who ever listened to history classes?<br/> <br/>With so many characters to keep up with, I could only get hold of our main ones – Frodo, Bilbo, Gandalf, Sam, Pippin, Aragorn, Merry. Sam might be my favorite and his undisputed loyalty to his master is what I loved the most. Honestly, everyone else was rather unlikable and their voices sounded the same – too cheery, unnecessarily excited, always uttering sentences that end with an exclamation mark. <br/>Like, this is how it is when a character speaks – <br/><br/><b><i> “Long have I desired to look upon the likeness of Isildur and Anarion, my sire of old. Under their shadow Elessar, the Elfstone son of Arathorn of the House of Valandil Isildur’s son, heir of Elendil, has naught to dread!”</b></i><br/><br/>¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/><br/>Point is, I think the whole trilogy could’ve been shortened to just this book and Tolkien could have saved a lot many tress if he just told the story at once, instead of having us go through so much useless babbling over nothing. By the end, nothing of significance had happened, except that our characters are ready to walk more. But the oncoming adventure promised to be more exciting and dangerous So I’m up for it! <br/><br/>------ ** ------ ** ------ ** ------ ** ------<br/><br/><b><u>Initial review - </u></b><br/><br/>For the past few months, I've been trying to pen down a complex book on unsolicited relationships, which has barely progressed a page, meanwhile Tolkien has managed to fill up over 500 pages with detailed, rich, long descriptive sentences on WALKING.<br/><br/>Yeah.<br/><br/>That was 12 hours of my life I'm never getting back. <br/><br/><br/>〰️〰️〰️〰️〰️〰️〰️〰️〰️〰️〰️〰️<br/><br/><br/>Buddy read with <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4919283-jennifer-jen-the-tolkien-gal"">my childhood friend Pippin aka Jen</a>, <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31153167-bhavik"">my closest companion Sam aka Bhavik</a>, <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69472742-rusty-grey"">my distant pal Aragorn aka Rusty</a><br/><br/>As for me, I'm Frodo, reading a book about my own adventures.<br/><br/>Also shoutout to the guy who left us midway and went off on his own <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58818027-fares"">Merry aka Fares</a>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

But the plot went hallelujah here and I’m not going to be<i> weak </i>enough to overlook that fact and give this book five stars. <br/><br/>I’m not going to bother you or myself with a summary, because this book depends entirely on what happened in the prequels, so bear with me while I rant xD<br/><br/><b>Obv, ****SPOILERS AHEAD****</B><br/><br/><u>SO MANY PLOTHOLES</u>. Let’s see how crappy my memory is, because I didn’t note these down.<br/><br/><b>1. The Escape</b><blockquote><br/><br/>•	<b>Alina isn’t able to summon sunlight</b> while in the White Cathedral, which is basically an underground tunnel, supposedly because sunlight is out of reach.<br/>•	But while they’ve escaped and are running through an underground tunnel, <b>she manages to summon light and keep them illuminated and warm,</b> <br/>•	Plus she can summon at night or when they’re in The Fold.<br/>•	If she can summon light when the sun is all the way across the other side of the planet, then surely being underground shouldn’t matter? Hmm?</blockquote><br/><br/><b>2. The History</b><blockquote><br/><br/>•	Why did Baghra suddenly decide to indulge Alina with the story of her past? <br/>•	And besides, how exactly did Morozova bring back his dead child? It’s mentioned that he used <i>merzost</i>, <b>but it’s not acknowledged just why other Grishas can’t do the same. <br/>•	WHO IS ALINA STARKOV? </b>Where does her last name come from, if they’ve no idea of her past? <br/>•	Also, how did she get her power, if The Darkling got his from his mother? So there must have been other sun summoners before her, which apparently isn’t the case.</blockquote><br/><br/><b>3. FLYING</b><br/><blockquote><br/>•	I still don’t get how their ship flies. <br/>•	To even create that ship, a lot of effort and time are required,<b> but Nikolai has flying ships hanging on his backyard like he bought it on a sale.</b> And Nikolai isn’t even a Grisha!<br/>•	While hunting for the firebird, Zoya is flying the ship for like 16 hours, which would be enough work to make her drop dead. <br/>•	Like, <b>do you realize just how difficult it would be to manipulate air to make a ship fly? </b>That thing might be weighing tons + there are passengers aboard. <br/>•	And, doesn’t there need to be a steering or something? What if a mountain comes in between? A tree? A firebird? A volcra? <br/></blockquote><br/><b>4. THE BOND</b><br/><blockquote><br/>•	So Alina got bit by a <i>nichevo’ya</i> some time ago which drops a hint of darkness into her being – through a dark scar on her shoulder - <b>enabling her to have this <i>connection</i> of sorts with The Darkling.</b><br/>•	In the second book, The Darkling is able to spy on Alina and freak her out all the time because of it. They can talk, touch and kiss like it was real, even when they were miles away from each other.<br/>•	This time, somehow, <i>only Alina</i> can visit the Darkling and find out what he’s up to, which is how The Darkling lies to her about trapping innocent kids to lure her for a confrontation.<br/>•	And all the while, The Darkling is oblivious of Alina’s location; a party is out to search for her. <b>Couldn’t he simply have visited her in her head and found out? </b> <br/>•	Or does it somehow work only one-sided this time around?<br/></blockquote><br/><b>5. THE PLAN</b><blockquote><br/><br/>•	So basically, David has this little idea that Alina might be able to<b> bend light around objects to make them invisible.</b><br/>•	Obviously it works, and Bardugo even connects it to science (‘Google Invisibility Cloak Technology’, she says)<br/>•	And <b>their ridiculous, idiotic plan?</b> To barge in to the Fold invisible and startle The Darkling.<br/>•	Like heck! <b>There are about a dozen of them,</b> how does Alina think she can bend light around ALL OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME?? It would mean they’d all need to remain in the same position without moving, which basically ruins the purpose of their little excursion.<br/>•	And our <b>stupid, reckless Alina Starkov</b> goes on to the basement of the ship to free some kids who aren’t even there (it was always obvious!), all the while trying to keep her crew invisible at the same time.<br/>•	<b>TELL ME YOU HAVE READ OF SOMETHING MORE RIDICULOUS AND STUPID AND I’LL GIFT YOU A CANDY</b><br/></blockquote><br/><b>6. THE DARKNESS</b><blockquote><br/><br/>•	Like Alina summons light, the Darkling can summon darkness.<b> Apparently it’s genetic.</b><br/>•	I think we all know that darkness is the absolute absence of light. But with the Darkling, <b>he can summon darkness and everybody will still see through it.</b><br/>•	And he can<i> also</i> summon darkness to make people invisible.<br/>•	I mean<b> how many types of darkness do you know? </b>A see-through darkness, a see-nothing-but-darkness darkness? -_-<br/>•	ALSO, <b>The Darkling does something to Nikolai</b> where he unleashes a nichevo’ya onto his body which makes him basically the same like those monsters.<br/>•	But, <b>the Nichevo’yas can only be around The Darkling within a short circle radius of him;</b> but Nikolai is <i>flying</i> and following Alina miles away from The Darkling???<br/></blockquote><br/><b>7. THE AMPLIFIERS</b><br/><blockquote><br/>•	Near to the end of the book, we’re told that<b> the whole purpose of Malyen Oretsev was to be an amplifier for Alina.</b><br/>•	If her powers died when she killed him, then how exactly was she to combine the power of the amplifiers and supposedly destroy the Darkling? <br/>•	AND BLOODY HELL <b>HE SURVIVED THE KILL, </b>WHICH WAS A KNIFE TO HIS HEART.<br/>•	Now if that resurrection wasn’t <i>merzost</i>, tell me what is.<br/></blockquote><br/><b>8. THE ENDING</b><br/><blockquote><br/>•	When Alina kills Mal, <b>she loses her power and the power wields itself onto every other Grisha near her.</b><br/>•	Wtf, HOW DANGEROUS AND WORLD-THREATENING IS THAT????? Now all of them can summon light, and use THE CUT and threaten or rule the world as they like,  because sun summoners were SAINTS, apparently.<br/>•	Also,<b> can we all please share a laugh at how funny that ending was, especially the Darkling’s???</b><br/>•	I mean, <b>a stab with a knife!!!!</b> Lol. Remember Baghra said it took too much to kill the Darkling or the sun summoner? <b>Of course, no one could have picked up a knife and stabbed the Darkling in his sleep. </b> How difficult!<br/>•	AND DON’T FORGET HOW CONVENIENT IT WAS FOR ALINA TO LOSE HER POWER SO SHE COULD HAVE A HAPPILY-EVER-AFTER WITH HER DARLING MAL, WITHOUT ANY EGOISTICAL PROBLEMS TO AFFECT THEIR RELATIONSHIP. Phew!<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Besides all the crappy plot, here are some random thoughts that passed through my head while reading this book - <br/>•	<b>Nikolai’s entry</b> when Alina and party were captured by the militia was priceless.<br/>•	That hole-in-a-mountain-residence-thingy was,… ridiculous? <br/>•	So was, performing The Cut to slice off a mountain. <br/>•	Mal and The Darkling are <i><b>cousins</b></i>. <br/>•	Those<b> little snippets </b>from Mal and Alina’s past were too adorable. <br/>•	<b>Zoya’s sarcastic comments </b>and wit were my only boosters to keep reading.<br/>•	Book ends. Me - <i>*cringe*</i><br/><br/>Now don’t you dare tell me that this book was actually good and that I should know to read better? <br/>But I’d really appreciate it if you point out anything that I’ve missed.<br/><br/><b>So basically, this is not the first time a trilogy ending has disappointed me.</b> You all should be wary of the danger ahead if you decide to go through with this book. Fair warning xD<br/><br/><br/>----------------------------<br/><br/><b>Initial review -</b><br/><br/>If you are looking for a stupid, ridiculous, makes-no-sense book; this is what you're looking for.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

This story is nothing like it promises to be.<br/><br/> Sohil Ashvin Shah meets Prerna Sharma in a café, and introduces himself as an author. Prerna luckily gets a copy of his book and promises to reach out after reading it.<br/><br/>The story is narrated by Siddhant Shah, who’s working in Dubai. He meets Hritisha Jain, assistant manager at a company where he goes for evening classes. For Siddhant, it was love at first sight. Slowly they get closer and become best friends. Hritisha returns to India. And Siddhant’s parents start a bride-search for him. After a failed arranged-marriage-setup, Siddhant realizes he loves Hritisha, and they become a couple once she accepts his love-confession. From then on, it is a matter of surprises, family-meetups and convincing Hritisha’s family to accept Siddhant as their son-in-law.<br/><br/>The story is nothing new, and is partly based on the author’s life which is what makes it authentic. Sohil doesn’t hold back anything – the online chats, sexting, meetups and romance are all honestly depicted. But there were a few problems that made this book less enjoyable for me.<br/><br/>•	<u><b>The Concept of Beauty</b></u><br/><br/>I’m still bugged at how old-fashioned the concept of beauty is in this book. Just about any girl who’s fair skinned is called ‘beautiful’ and ‘girlfriend-material’. Like, this is how Siddhant reacts the moment he first sees Hritisha –<br/><br/><i> “Gosh! She was beautiful! My eyes started fixating on every inch of her flawless fair skin. There was not a single mark or zit on her face.”</i><br/><br/>And this is what Siddhant has to say about a waitress in a club he only just met -<br/><br/><i> “She was quite tall, slim and fair; anyone would fall in love with her at the very first sight.”</i><br/><br/>I mean, seriously? A zit on your face is natural; it’s a part of your teenage process. There’s nothing wrong with that.<b> Flawless fair skin should not be the default standard for beauty. </b>When will this trend stop? <br/><br/>•	<u><b>Fat-shaming</b></u><br/><br/>There is so much fat-shaming in this book. Siddhant is a bit overweight and Hritisha constantly ridicules him over it, asking him to diet, reduce his weight, and not be a fat-bimbo. And Siddhant is actually ashamed of his weight too, going along with whatever she says.<b> It is depicted as if being fat is a wrong way to be. </b> That’s ridiculous and I’m done with reading such shit, especially since half of the Indian population is overweight :/<br/><br/>•	<u><b>Insta-Love</b></u><br/><br/>The insta-love in this book is at its peak. You know how? <b>Siddhant falls in love with Hritisha from the very first moment he hears her voice through the phone.</b> He’s restless after that, he can’t sit still and is on constant lookout for<i> the girl with the silvery voice.</i> I mean, like wtf? That’s the most ridiculous way I’ve seen someone falling in love.<br/><br/>•	<u><b>The local slang and <i>shayari</i></b></u><br/><br/>The author used a lot of Gujarati words and local slang in this book. In fact an entire chapter was dedicated to the Gujarati poet Mareez Sahab. His <i>shayar</i> made frequent and well-timed appearance it his book. While I appreciate the author’s attempt to introduce his readers to local poetry, it was difficult to understand at times even though the translations come right afterward. There were too many of them, some of which I might have shamelessly skimmed through. It isn’t a pleasant experience to read in a language you don’t understand. We aren’t trying to get a language lesson; we’re more interested in the story. <b>The whole deal makes me feel like the targeted audience was rather too small</b>. The author was trying to tell his story, but he didn’t try to make it interesting enough for a wide range of audiences. I felt that the author confined the intended audience to a small group of people and anyone outside this circle won’t find the book interesting. If I ever write a story, I’d try to include my culture, but in an appealing kind of way. We need the readers to understand the perspective, not be repelled by it.<br/><br/>As for the book in whole, I wouldn’t exactly recommend it – the writing is sloppy and the narrative is a bit disoriented. But the dialogues felt natural, and not considering the insta-lovey beginning, there was real development between the main couple. And I loved how the author tried to answer our questions with his epilogue – Prerna meets Sohil to talk about his book, and she asks him questions about his book the readers would also have in mind. Even if they don’t answer the questions in the blurb, it helps us distinguish fiction from real life. <br/><br/><b>In short, there have been better debuts, but you cannot deny that the author is talented.<br/><br/><br/>------- * ------- * ------- * -------</b><br/><br/>Probably one of the reasons why no one reads Indian contemporary anymore. This was a poorly written version of [b:I Too Had a Love Story|7977973|I Too Had a Love Story|Ravinder Singh|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1270373915s/7977973.jpg|7364012] but I could see the author has some potential.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Nicholas Sparks weaves romantic lines from the simplest of words and they turn out cringey and good at the same time. <br/><br/><b>So, why the four stars? </b>This book was given to me by my uncle when I was barely fourteen. I remember reading it then and wondering if he had actually read it, and then thinking that if he had, then he must consider me mature enough to read this book, and feeling quite proud of the fact. Back then, I swooned over the romance, though<b> neither the characters nor the romance itself is swoon worthy.</b> I remember really loving the<b> miracle</b> aspect of the novel, of how Sparks thought that miracles really do happen, of hoping I’d encounter a miracle myself and be forced to believe the same. Rereading it now, expecting what is to come, I knew there wasn’t going to be any mind-blowing moments or anything remotely close. This is merely the way it is for me, and not a book I’d recommend to others. Looking at all the one-star reviews, I understand why this novel failed to please so many readers, but nevertheless, it remains one of the very few books I own, and so, it’s too important for me to not love it. I realize I sound as cheesy and corny as Sparks does in this book, so I’d get on with the review. <br/><br/>Noah Taylor Calhoun has loved only once. The summer he turned seventeen, he met Allie Nelson at a festival in his home town of New Bern in North Carolina. Allie was there for nearly two months, but those two months lasted a lifetime for the two of them. They met each day and made memories and slowly fell irrevocably in love. Fast forward, Noah is thirty-one and alone, renovating an old house he had always loved - losing himself in work - trying to stay away from the memories of the hazel-eyed girl he’d once fallen in love with. Allie is twenty-nine, engaged, and lives a routine life she’d always thought she’d lead. But an encounter with each other was all they needed. The old memories rush in. Bonding over candle-light dinner and kayak rides, the two once again discover why they’d fallen for each other, and even more, that they’d never stopped.<br/><br/>Noah and Allie’s relationship while at first might seem like insta-love, there are a thousand memories that make up their chemistry, but unfortunately the author doesn’t deem them necessary enough to share with his readers. The summer they initially met is mentioned many times, but only in conversation. We don’t get to see what or why they fell in love, nor do we get to see the development that is so obviously there. Sparks makes it work though; he makes us believe that Noah and Allie truly share a wonderful past, that there were some wonderful moments that keep them bonded. I only wish we could’ve experienced it with them.<br/><br/>What I loved the most was the family dynamic in this book. Noah’s father has no role here, but he’s so often present in Noah’s thoughts. I love how he made his father sound like this wise old man, who’d loved his son and raised him to be the tough, nature-loving gentleman that he is. And then there is this one instance, where Noah talks about losing a child and how it feels, of growing up together with your family, bringing up kids – they all hit right on the spot. I also loved Allie’s mother, who despite everything, loved her daughter and wanted her to be happy no matter what.<br/>The vivid, clear description of New Bern and the natural aura, the kayaking, canoeing, rain, art and paintings; everything felt heartrendingly nice to me. Even though this book is supposed to be set around the time of Second World War, we don’t get to see the bad side – the depression, the deaths, the bloodshed and poverty. I can’t decide if that is a good thing or bad.<br/><br/><b>The Romance?</b> If you have the patience for long-drawn, meant-to-be-poetic-but-are-actually-sap kinda romantic letters and descriptions of sex, then maybe you’ll love this book. There’s no way in hell that actual people speak the way Noah does, there’s no way people actually write such cringe-worthy letters. It is unrealistic, yes, for the most part. But what do you expect from a romance? The chemistry between Noah and Allie felt real to me, but sometimes hasty. I’d say the character of Lon Hammond had no real significance in this book, and the male characters all act a little too gentlemanly (there are only two of them actually). But I loved reading the very realistic concerns of an old man groping over his upcoming death, reminiscing his long life and feeling ancient – they felt real and believable, as if the author himself had such thoughts bothering him. <br/><br/><b>The Ending ?</b> was far too stretched and the author dwelt on the same thing again and again, as if he didn’t know how to end it all and was waiting for inspiration to strike. There were some fillers, some boring parts – unnecessary additions that could’ve been avoided. Otherwise, there wasn’t a real ending at all.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Four seems like an injustice to this book, considering that I’ve been four-starring books that are nowhere near as good as this. I’ll settle for a <b>4.5/5 stars.</b><br/><br/><b><u>The Plot</b></u><br/><br/><blockquote>An American Marriage is a quick read. <b>It is about being black in America, being married, being in love, and being away from your loved ones for too long. </b> Roy Othaniel Hamilton and Celestial Davenport are in their earliest stage of marriage – the settling down stage. They have it all – money, home, car, jobs and a promising future. But when life decides to throw them lemons, they forget to make lemonades. Andre and Celestial have always been best friends since childhood. When things with her husband gets bad, Celestial turns to Andre for comfort. <br/><b>Would being together by obligation beat being together by love? And what does it mean, to be a black man in America?</b></blockquote><br/><br/><b><u>The Writing</b></u><br/><br/><blockquote>It is written in three-person point-of-view. Unlike many other books attempting multiple point-of-views, this book actually manages to let you know where you are, who’s talking. It works, this three pov thing, and it is actually what makes us readers get hooked.<br/><b>It was amazing, the pacing and plotting of this book. </b> There wasn’t a single moment to be bored. Even though the book is about 400+ pages, you just fly by. The writing was really familiar to me, it felt really smooth, and didn’t take time to get used to. <b>The story was completely satisfactory.</b> No loose, dangling threads, no issues unaddressed.  The ending could have been a total let-down, if it wasn’t handled right,<b> which was fortunately not the case.</b></blockquote><br/><br/><b><u>The Characters</b></u><br/><br/><blockquote>A cast of well-developed characters and the complex relationships between them is what makes this book a winner.  BUT, if there was anything lacking for me in this book, it was <b><i>emotional attachment</i></b>. <b>I couldn’t really feel for the characters, and I suspect Tayari Jones deliberately made it that way. </b>You see, <b>you can’t take sides in this book.</b> There comes a time when you’re forced to, when people make bad decisions, when you consider one person well over the other. But really, Jones leaves no space for siding up. All three characters are on their own, and all you feel for them is empathy. Believe me, you just can’t take sides. I’ve tried. Even with the depth and closeness to reality these characters exhibit, there was something lacking too. The intensity. Somehow it works too. </blockquote><br/><br/><b><u>The relationships</u></b><br/><br/><blockquote>The complexity of the relationships in this book is mind-blowing.<b> And the intricately delicate way Jones handled it, was brilliant it say the least.</b> Roy and Celestial’s relationship was fragile from the start. They’ve been married for only about one-and-a-half year before tragedy strikes. On the other hand Andre and Celestial have known each other for a long time. This complexity shows throughout the story. But I have to say, <b>the connection, the chemistry between the leads was missing.</b> Again, I don’t know if it was deliberate, because it would only have complicated things more. <b>All throughout the book, I felt like Jones never intended for her readers to connect to the story, for her characters to be intense,<u> just so we could focus on the big picture.</u></b> It must have worked, because all I cared for was how it all ended. And it ended well. Though, I was a bit disappointed a bit with the turn of events in Roy’s life. <spoiler>He ends up with the woman with whom he spends the first two nights after his release. </spoiler> There wasn’t much visible growth in the character’s lives.<br/><br/>What I loved the most about this book, were THE PARENTS. Roy’s mama Olive and daddy Big Roy were one of the best parents I’ve read of. That was family goals. I loved Big Roy so much. I wished we had more of Olive though. Celestial’s parents were really well developed and impactful too. I especially loved Mr. Davenport and his devoted loyalty to Roy and the Black community. Also, I’ve got to say this - <b>having read so much on family and relationships, I feel like the Black community has the most intense relationship and the deepest connection to each other. </b>They care so much for their brothers and sisters, their family, their fellow countrymen. It’s unnerving, their emotional attachment. It’s relationship goals. They’d die defending their friends and family. And I think the rest of the world has a lot to learn from the way the black people treat each other. </blockquote><br/><br/>To sum up,<b> this book is one of the best book of 2018 I’ve read so far, and I believe it would be throughout the year. </b> There are some amazing life lessons to be gained from this book.

It was well over six years ago, but I still remember how I finished reading it in one-sitting, one hefty afternoon when my cousin had come over. He was talking to my sister, and by the time I’d finished, they were still talking! Anyway, this book is nowhere as good as how it appeared to me back then. But still, you have to give Stine some credit. That guy has some serious creepy-book-writing talent. <br/><br/>Lucy is twelve always cooks up monster stories to scare her 6-yo brother. She’s usually obsessed over monsters, and it’s easy to scare her brother Randy and even her best friend Aaron. But one day, she happens to witness their town librarian Mr. Mortman turning into an actual monster and eating yucky moths and flies. Turns out, nobody believes her. Her mother thinks it’s just another monster story she made up to keep away from the library. But Lucy is determined to have them believe her, she’s going to show them proof. And meanwhile, she needs to make sure the monster doesn’t realize she knows his secret, or she’d be his next meal instead of the flies! <br/><br/>It’s amazing how easily Stine comes up with such believable characters and cooks up such ridiculously creepy stories. But they’re entertaining and easy to read. I didn’t particularly like Lucy because she was stupid, and never treated her best friend Aaron, right. Neither did he, for that matter. Though that’s understandable because they’re kids. The ending was a big twist I didn’t see coming. <spoiler>Lucy’s whole family actually feed on monsters and have fangs! </spoiler> <br/><br/>For a goosebumps book, it was pretty good thrill. But it’s still childish and sometimes even a bit predictable. Otherwise though, a quick easy scare!<br/>",,,2,,,0,,,,,

I mean, look at it? It’s just a chick, there’s nothing else. But I love its simplicity and the idea in general (I know you're gonna judge my poor choices or something, but I love what I love, get over it ;)<br/><br/><b>Flipped is not a romance,</b> despite what the book might want you to believe. It’s more of a coming-of-age story about two different kids, with problems and personality of their own. Bryce Loski is a shy teenager, and has hated Juli Baker ever since the first day he saw her when they moved to her neighborhood and she fell for him, or more like his blue eyes. The outgoing, enthusiastic girl that she is, Juli still fails to impress Bryce. But then, Juli starts to realize that Bryce is more than his blue eyes, and Bryce starts to realize that what matters are the matters of the heart.<br/><br/>•	Bryce’s pov was really impressive to read. He talks to us like it matters to him how we see things, and it felt refreshing to be included and considered.<br/><br/>•	Juli seemed a little too over-enthusiastic and idk, over-the-top in almost everything she does, in her crush on Bryce, her love for the sycamore, her daily actions in general. <br/><br/>•	Both of the characters aren’t particularly likeable. But I did like reading Juli’s view on everything. She looks ‘at the big picture’.<br/><br/>•	Idk, but Juli’s and Bryce’s family were weird. Like <i><b>very very weird </i></b> and <u>unrealistic.</u><br/><br/>•	Like, take Juli’s brother for an instance – owning a boa constrictor? Isn’t that illegal or something? Also, Bryce’s dad was a dick and Bryce himself was a coward. But I loved Juli’s dad and Bryce’s mom – they were the only sensible people in the book.<br/><br/>•	The whole ‘Basket Boy’ thing was really weird and funny and idk, unbelievable. Selling boys and their handsome face for money? It was kinda cruel if you ask me. I mean, if it were ‘Basket Girls’ the whole world would have been chasing the school authorities with pitchforks. But alas, those poor unfortunate boys have nobody to speak up for them.<br/><br/>•	<b>The Ending</b> in my opinion was unsatisfactory. True, the author succeeded on giving us a mental picture of how things might go on. But it felt abrupt and scraped off a bark. There wasn’t much of a conclusion, any confrontation of sorts or anything pleasing in general. I wasn’t ready to buy it.<br/><br/>This book is just another coming-of-age book. The characters are unique in the sense that, they’re weird and don’t try hard to be relatable or anything. But the message as a whole was promising and hopeful. I wish I could’ve read this as a child. Definitely something I’d buy my kids though. It’s got a lot to teach young kids. Recommended.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Most of my favorite books started out as almost-DNFed ones. While this book won’t be categorized as a favorite, <b>it was profound, evocative and moving in a way I’ve never imagined possible.</b> If I happen to reread this book, and I will, I’m sure I will soak up the words and let it flow through me because I’d be aware that this book is<b> an artful masterpiece.</b><br/><br/><b><u>The Plot</u></b><br/><br/><blockquote> Noah and Jude. <br/><br/>Jude and Noah. <br/><br/>They were born together, bound together with more than blood. <b>They are the Sweetwine twins.</b><br/><br/>But they couldn’t have been less similar. <br/><br/>Noah is an artist, gay, and shy. Fearing the homophobic world, he’s struggling to find his place in the world, to express his over-imaginative mind, and he does it in the only way he knows – through his art. Having had his dreams shattered, and bearing the terrible secret of his family’s destruction, Noah gives up art, and pretends to be everything he is not.<br/><br/>Jude on the other hand, overwhelmed by guilt and shame, shrinks into herself, loses her former outgoing nature and tries to do what she has always tried to do – impress their mother and convince her that she’s as good an artist as Noah.<br/><br/>The lies were convincing. <br/><br/>But can they be true to themselves?<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The plot was non-existent for the first half, but the second half was worth it. Everything comes together, and while things were predictable, it still amazed me. <b> It’s brilliantly crafted and the execution is spot on.</b> The story makes sense, the writing makes sense, everything makes sense by the end.<br/><br/><b><u>Now, here’s an overview of what will happen when you read this book</u></b> –<br/><blockquote><br/>-	You’ll start reading and immediately start procrastinating because it’s boring.<br/>-	You start to realize that you’ve no idea what you’re reading.<br/>-	You have to look up <u>metaphor </u>in the dictionary.<br/>-	You’ll be aware that the characters are all too over-dramatic and too teenager-ey for your taste.<br/>-	You’ll forget that <u>‘twin-thing’</u> ever existed.<br/>-	You’ll realize that your fights with your siblings are mere pinpricks compared to what you’re reading.<br/>-	Halfway through the book, you realize that <i><b>there actually is a plot</b></i>!!<br/>-	And then you realize you can’t stop reading.<br/>-	You get a newfound love for art.<br/>-	You get wide-eyed at places and see stars and colors and glitter.<br/>-	And you cry and you cry and you cry.<br/>-	You marvel at how the story is an intricate pattern of woven words and how brilliantly the story is crafted.<br/>-	You realize you need to reread this book asap to soak in its beauty.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I’m telling you, getting through this book is no small job. <b>Jandy Nelson’s writing is an artwork.</b> Sometimes you’ll stare at it for a long time without comprehending anything at all. Sometimes you stare at it and feel like you’re floating through the universe, passing through the Milky Way, with comets and meteors and glittering stars scattered in the sky like a cake frosted with confetti and sprinkles, just like artworks that speak to you. It’s difficult to read and know what’s happening sometimes due to the metaphorical talks, and sometimes you just wonder how she managed to weave sentences where the words are delicate pieces of puzzle falling rightly into place. The writing was quite annoying in the beginning, and only later did I realize its whole purpose and how it actually compliments the character’s behavior. <br/><br/>As for <b>the characters,</b> let me tell you – the twins you’re going to encounter is no ordinary twins. <b>They are basically personified metaphors.</b> They’re too pretentious and over-dramatic, make all the wrong choices, regret all the said choices, and still live like there’s no tomorrow. <b>Noah’s pov was annoying to read. </b> He was obsessed over Brian; he exaggerates and overly analyses everything he sees. And according to him, everything that happens in the world has something to do with him. I felt he was selfish at times. Frankly though, I loved Noah better when I was reading Jude’s point of view. In fact, I liked everything better while reading Jude’s pov. But Noah’s pov, even though annoying and confusing at times, was actually<b> an accurate portrayal of an artistic mind.</b> I loved Jude for all the mistakes and guilt and shame she carried on her back. I loved reading her thoughts. It was relatable and funny at times. And needless to say, Guillermo Garcia is probably my favorite person right now. Also, <b>there is so much focus on art in this book and IT IS DONE SO SOO WELL.</b> Seriously, Noah’s pov tells you a lot about an artist’s mind and the paintings and sculptures and everything else are described so artistically, it’s imaginative and inspiring. Clearly, <b>Jandy Nelson knows her art.</b> <b>Oscar Ralph, on the other hand, was an unflattering character.</b> There’s basically zero characteristic traits to him, except that he’s a womanizer who had a bad past and has suffered quite a lot. I didn’t enjoy his presence, and I sure af didn’t swoon over the romance. And also, <b>Brian.</b> He was basically a manic-pixie-dream boy and I had no sympathy for him So simply put, <b>the characters are all merely plot devices.</b> <br/><br/><b>As for the relationships,</b> it was so freaking fantastic to see Noah and Jude’s relationship develop from hatred, to sympathy, to love and something much more. They make me believe in second chances and rainbows and unicorns and the magic power of forgiveness and love. They have such an awesome chemistry, you guys!! Even if they spoke barely a word to each other. I hated their parents though, both of them were stinking and reeking of stereotypes and they treated their children like they bought them off the market on sale. It was frustrating.<br/><br/>One of the best relationships that developed here was the one between Jude and Garcia. They’re adorable together, and they share a lovely bond, I can only understand but not explain. It’s LOVELY. Other than that, the romance help zero appeal to me, because – lack of development. It was like, you meet this guy, you see his eyes, fall in love, and decide you’re soul mates. Crap. I don’t buy it. And it’s impossible to believe <spoiler>that Brian comes back after two years, and gets back with Noah just like that</spoiler>. Nope.<br/><br/><b>Overall, </b>as difficult as it was, to really get into this book, IT WAS ABSOUTELY WORTH IT IN THE END. I can really see the reason for hype and it was justified in every ways. Even though the characters and story were a bit unrealistic, it was enjoyable and thought-provoking and brilliantly crafted. I’d definitely recommend it if you’re interested in contemporary stories with a bit of a magical-touch.<br/> <br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

That’s how eleven-year-olds Luke Mitchell and Elma Davey start writing letters to each other all the way from Ireland to England. At first, it was all lies and made-up stuff. Stories they told each other of how their lives were perfect, stories they said to themselves to make them feel better about their own harsh realities. Until they realize that their lives are pretty similar - that they have no one else to confide to - other than each other. <br/><br/>  I really loved the concept of the book and adored how the authors brought the book to life. Luke and Elma seem like real persons with real problems. They are eleven year olds, true. <i><b>But they feel like real living persons trying to pretend their life is better than what it actually is.</b> </i><br/><br/>  It was refreshing to see them bond through the letters, even if they were lies. The way they made a little ritual of sticking their stamps upside-down just to see if the other would notice, how they sent Christmas cards they didn’t actually mean to send, and how they help each other and bring about big changes in their lives. <spoiler> Elma’s Dad gets better with Luke’s suggestion to sign him up for a quiz </spoiler>. It was adorable and heart-warming – made me smile all along. <br/><br/> I really loved Luke’s character; he seemed way too old for someone his age. That guy works each day and weekends, earns 50 euros every week, and buys his mom a washing machine for Christmas! Way to go boy! Elma had her share of problems too, but I wasn’t very impressed with her way of dealing with them. And in the end, she felt a bit arrogant, walking away with her problems solved when Luke really could have used some help. <br/><br/><b>Unlike You’ve Got Mail, this book isn’t about unions and happy endings. </b> In the end, Luke and Elma are just pen pals, both from different countries, both with their share of problems, both trying to get through with life. <b>And that’s what makes it even more realistic and good.</b> I was satisfied, to say the least.<br/><br/>This book isn’t another romance where penpals meet in real life and stick together life-long. This is simply a story of two kids striving with their lives. You just need something like this when you think your life is hard. It reminds you that no matter how bad your problems are, there are people who are having it worse. It’s simple, humble and yet hopeful.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I’m not much of a character driven reader as a plot-driven one, but WOW THIS BOOK HAD THEM BOTH.<br/><br/>Picking up a week later after the events in Burn for Burn, we see the trio – Kat, Lillia, Mary – are still hanging out with each other (which gives me all the feels!), unbeknownst to Lillia’s popular gang of friends. To rid Mary off her grief and heartbreak, they decide that Reeve needs to get avenged with heartbreak similar to hers, and Lillia is up for the job. The series of events that occur is something they could’ve never imagined. <br/><br/>❇	<b>THE PLOT</B><blockquote><br/>I was worried that there wasn’t going to be anything to keep the plot going after everything that went down in the last book, but no! This is just as interesting, and emotional, and dwells so much on character development. And the plot twist was mind-blowing, even if most things were predictable up to that point. And even though, not everything was resolved in the end of this book, it was a huge cliffhanger which builds up so much potential for the next book to dwell on.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>❇	<b>THE CHARACTERS and WRITING</b><blockquote><br/>The book is narrated through three povs – Kat, Lillia and Mary’s. I have to say this, even though the book is written by two people, it doesn’t feel like it at all. You can try all you want, but you can’t distinguish the lines between Han and Vivian, and it truly makes it all the more amazing. Also, <b>the authors have succeeded in giving the three protagonists distinct voices that you have no difficulty in placing them whatsoever, its exceptional.</b> Like, my edition of this book had the chapter titles missing, and still, I could easily identify who was narrating, just by the first sentence. Now, let me put it there fair and square –<br/><br/><b>KAT DeBRASSIO IS MY NEW FAVORITE CHARACTER</b>. Totally. I love her bratty nature, her loyalty, her tendency to hide her grief, just about everything about that girl.<br/>Also, <b>Lillia Cho </b>annoyed me a bit with her arrogant nature here. I mean she’s super rich, but in the first book, she’s sorta generous about it, but here she’s all showing off and spoilt. <br/>As for <b>Mary Zane</b>, I didn’t like her enough in the first book either. I knew she was gonna get creepy by the end. And her non-stop pining over Reeve was absolutely unbelievable, I wanted to slap her. The side characters, Rennie, Reeve, Alex, Nadia – everyone’s so developed and have so much though put on them, it’s astonishing.<br/><br/>So, the point is,<b> these characters feel so real and believable. I don’t know how they come up with such detailed characters.</b><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>❇	<b>THE ENDING</B>	<blockquote><br/><b>It was abrupt and jaw-dropping and nerve-wracking and everything that stands for thrilling and exciting. </b> It was a freaking roller coaster. Even though not everything is resolved in this book, the way the girls bond gives us friendship goals and the ending hints that it might all fall apart. I don’t know what to think about it, but I sure as hell jumped right into the next book after that.

I expected a lot better ending from the authors who write some of the best realistic fiction I’ve known, but looks like they went a bit overboard with the supernatural plot.<br/><br/>Taking off after that unexpected twist in Fire with fire, the book moves right into action – the sizzling Tabatsky-Cho romance, Kat’s awesomeness and along with that, Mary turns maliciously crazy with her plan to avenge Reeve. This time, she’s against two of her best friends. And they’d have to do anything it takes to stop her.<br/><br/>•	<b>THE PLOT</B> <br/><br/><BLOCKQUOTE>	Romancing your best friend’s crush, a dead spirit seeking revenge – only seen by two people, them trying to ward off the spirit. <b>Like I said, THE PLOT WAS EVERTYTHING LIKE AN INDIAN SOAP OPERA.</B>  It was cringe-worthy, but at the same time,<b> the writing was super good and thrilling and you just cannot take your eyes off the page.</b> Only these two authors could’ve executed such a crappy plot so freaking well. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>•	<b>THE CHARACTERS</b><br/><blockquote><br/>✴	<b>Lillia Cho</b> - Her transformation from the loving, generous Asian girl to an arrogant, selfish girl was noteworthy. I still liked her, because her heart was in the right place, and she just couldn’t have NOT done what she did. But really, the authors didn’t have to make her a rich arrogant, spoilt brat. She was really fine in the first book.  <br/><br/>✴	<b>Kat DeBrassio</b> - Still my favorite. I love her intelligent nature, brassy attitude, her loyalty, her love for her family, everything about her. <br/><br/>✴	<b>Mary Zane</b> - She is barely recognizable from how she was in the first two books. Typical cliché character degradation – from loving, sweet and innocent girl to evil, malicious girl. But there was some kind of hilarity and immaturity to her behavior that I felt was very Mary-like.<br/><br/>✴	<b>Reeve Tabatsky</b> - As evil and bad he might have been, my heart went out for this guy. He had to suffer a lot more than he deserved. From losing his future and his best friend – to being driven crazy by supernatural forces and having his heart broken – I’d say he didn’t deserve any of it. True, his attitude towards Elizabeth had been bratty, but he couldn’t have known that she’d kill herself. And he regretted it his whole life. And besides, he was the only guy who didn’t get a good ending.<br/><br/>✴	<b>Alex</b> - He felt like a plot-fueler, a sidekick only meant to fuel up the plot. I didn’t like his character much, there wasn’t much development, and he was annoying sometimes with his obsession towards Lillia Cho.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>•	<b>THE RELATIONSHIPS</B>	<br/><blockquote><br/>✴	Needless to say, I was totally aboard the Tabatsky-Cho ship. It was so very well developed; there was some real chemistry between them, even if I did feel that they were totally not matched as couples.<br/> <br/>✴	<b>The friendship</b> between Kat and Lillia was really lovable and felt very real. I loved how they were there for each other throughout, and how understanding and supportive Kat was with Lillia’s decision to date Reeve. A solid friendship, even without Mary.<br/><br/>✴	<b>The family</b> of DeBrassios felt very real. Even though Kat’s brother Pat, was a dick when it came to being a big brother, their family and the bond they shared melted my heart, and seeing Kat torn between her family and her dream of Oberlin was EVERYTHING.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>•	<b>THE ENDING</b><br/><blockquote><br/>✴	<b>The Climax</b>. Whoa, really? Such stupid crap? It was rushed and there was no much talking and understanding, it was just wrapped up in a thrilling, nice, <i>very convenient</i> way. DISAPPOINTED IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.<br/><br/>✴	But<b> I loved how the themes of suicide and self-harm were addressed, .</b> though really, it could have been given more importance than just being a plot-twist.<br/><br/>✴	The epilogue was AWFUL. <spoiler> How could Lillia be with someone whom she never ever had feelings for? And how could she even leave Reeve when they loved each other like crazy? I didn’t see WHY they had to be separated. It’s not like Rennie or Mary was alive or anything. There was no reason, it was like they were together and so in love one day and not together anymore the next. But the most awful of all was Lillia going with Alex. As much as that guy loved Lillia his whole life, THERE WAS ZERO CEMISTRY, ABSOLUTELY NO DEVELOPMENT, MUCH LESS ANY REAL FEELINGS BETWEEN THEM. Also, I could see how Reeve and Kat could’ve been a thing, their attitudes totally match. But the authors just had to break our hearts and leave poor Reeve alone and heartbroken -_- </spoiler> <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>As much as I hated how the whole trilogy wrapped up I did have a really good time reading it, I actually enjoyed the excited chill in my spine throughout the book. I have always loved and adored [a:Jenny Han|151371|Jenny Han|https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1492645464p2/151371.jpg] and her books, and I’m willing to try more of [a:Siobhan Vivian|800187|Siobhan Vivian|https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1447441386p2/800187.jpg] now – <b>these authors have some serious writing skill. </b>This book and the ending does no justice to the previous two books, and <b>I really wish it had ended some other way. </b>But what’s done is done and was done very well.<br/><b>2.5/5 stars</b><br/><br/>--------------------<br/><br/><b>Initial review - </B><br/><br/>I don't know how the authors manage to make the book so compelling even with such a crappy plot. <br/><br/>I've hated the endings to almost all the trilogies I've read, I'm surprised this doesn't go all the way down to 1 star.

My point is, the fact that it is a fan-fiction was alien to me until I saw other reviews, which only go on to prove how you can actually read this book tension-free.<br/><br/>My jumbled thoughts make no sense even to myself, and yet, here I am - <br/><blockquote><br/>•	<b>The Shadowhunter world</b>. A compelling new world, with all sorts of paranormal beings from warlocks to vampires to <i>nephilims</i>. At first, it was confusing, and I also discovered that I dislike demons, but once you catch up, it’s actually pretty interesting.<br/>•	<b>The Mortal Instruments.</b> While I can see how the Mortal Cup can be dangerous in the wrong hands, I was stuck thinking about the remaining two Mortal Instruments and where they might be.<br/>•	<b>Writing style.</b> Language-wise, it was really good and convincing, but there was ABSOLUTELY ZERO EMOTIONAL DEPTH TO HER WRITING STYLE. I was mostly numb while reading this, except towards the last, where it got quite action-packed and thrilling.<br/>•	<b>Clarissa Fray.</b> Clary’s character has to be one of the least developed protagonists I’ve ever read in my life. There is nothing about her character I know, except that she is an artist, has an unwitting crush on Jace, our hero, and is <i>exceptionally dumb and ignorant</i> when it comes to others’ feeling and emotions. Simon’s crush on her was totally obvious right from the first page but our poor Clary had no idea for the past 16 years. <b>What bothered me most about her was that she had practically no role in the book</b>. During every other action scene, it was like she just blended into thin air, as if she were invisible. She was useless most of the times, never bothered enough to care about her friends who were fighting for her and even when she <i>recklessly</i> ventured of to save her beloved ones, SHE IS JUST STANDING THERE WATCHING. Most of the scenes we see through her eyes, but she has zero role in it, as if she were watching a TV show in virtual reality. Also, her conduct towards Simon wasn’t impressive and I really found it hard to connect with her in general. And she hated Isabelle simply for her good looks which is UNACCEPTABLE. <br/>•	<b>Jace Wayland.</b> Perhaps better fleshed-out than Clary was, Jace might be my favorite character. His tendency to enjoy violence was intimidating at times, but can be overlooked by his actual sense of righteousness, his protective stance against Clary, given that he had a crappy upbringing. <br/>•	<b>Simon.</b> He was a really good side-character too, by Clare saved his only for special occasions, making him rather a dull lovesick puppy. His character had so much potential but I feel all of them were promptly overlooked.<br/>•	<b>Isabelle and Alec Lightwood.</b> The twins were an interesting bunch, but I was disappointed with their development too. Alec’s mysterious ambiguity might have been made to look charming but he faded into the background. As for Isabelle, her only role was to look beautiful.<br/>•	The characters of <b>Magnus Bane and Luke</b> were a nice touch. I rather liked Bane for his sarcasm and uniqueness. As for <b>Valentine</b>, I have no idea how to interpret his character. He was basically meant to be a dummy Voldemort, with a lot less ferocity.<br/>•	CAN WE NOW TALK ABOUT <b>THE ENDING?</b> I wanted to GAG. Badly. Even if there weren’t loose ends or anything, Clare threw a “Gotcha!” at her readers <spoiler>by making our love interests siblings. wtf?</spoiler> It spoiled many things for me, and after that I just couldn’t read the book the same way. Most of the adult characters turned out to be unreliable, the kids were left on their own and with that ending, everything just became awkward and bleak.<br/>•	I really wished it had a smoother, faster pace, though. <br/></blockquote><br/>I wouldn't know who'd like this book, and I can't fathom what is so interesting in it to give it five stars, but knowing its popularity, it may be worth the try. You might have the balls to endure icky demons and squirming-worm-bodied creatures though. <br/><br/>-------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Thanks to my friends the die-hard Cassandra Clare fan<a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67984117""> LAKDEV</a> and the ever-critical-reader<a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52844833-laura-herondale""> Laura </a>for making me push past my comfort zone and discover Cassandra Clare.

After I realized that I wasn’t going to like Leah, it was the only reason I kept reading this book. I lived for the ‘Bluques’ mentions, a.k.a the cutesy, absolutely quirkily-adorable appearances of the golden couple. I started loving Simon even more after this book.<br/><br/>•	Also, Leah’s Mom was fantastic <u>(She doesn’t have a name??)</u>. She’s my new favorite.

It’s totally my opinion and I’m free to have them, as you are free to have yours. Thanks.<br/>Uh yeah, how do I start? <br/><br/>•	<b>Leah Burke</b><br/><br/>Leah was an adorable friend in Simon Vs. and I do still think that she is a good friend to Simon, but,  SHE IS THE MOST GODDAMN ANNOYING CHARACTER I HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN A WHILE. Ever since Rose Hathaway, <b>I have never had to loathe a character that I initially loved. </b> Simply, Leah was rude to pretty much everyone in her life, she has anger management issues she doesn’t recognize, and she is the most selfish fictional person I’ve had to encounter.<br/><blockquote><br/><br/>&#x1f6ab;	Her attitude towards Garret? <b>Rude.</b> He has a huge crush on her but she never once thought of telling him she wasn’t interested. <br/>&#x1f6ab;	Like, she was literally bouncing him on her knees, teasing him high.<br/>&#x1f6ab;	She was furious at Abby for teasing her, when Abby didn’t even know she was bi? <b>Hypocritic binch</b>.<br/>&#x1f6ab;	The way she lied to Garrett about attending his game, and not even clarifying with him later when Simon advised her to. <br/>&#x1f6ab;	I can tolerate everything, but lying that bad, and not even feeling guilty. NOT ACCEPTABLE.<br/>&#x1f6ab;	You know what her reason was for engaging Garret? <b>She never before felt needed or liked.</b> I. CANT. EVEN. <br/>&#x1f6ab;	She treated her Mom like TRASH. She never allowed her to speak for herself; she never ever gave her a chance to have a life. And her Mom is actually the sweetest person on the planet.<br/>&#x1f6ab;	The way she treated her friends Anna and Morgan. Yeah it was sweet and all at first, but then she drops them off like tissues and isn’t willing to forgive Morgan even when she apologized.<br/>&#x1f6ab;	And she actually compared Morgan to Martin?? Wtf? As if she and Martin were the bestest buddies before Simon happened!<br/>&#x1f6ab;	Also in between all the Morgan drama, SHE TOTALLY FORGETS ABOUT HER OTHER FRIEND ANNA.

Her conduct towards him and his heartbreak was IMPOSSIBLE.<br/>&#x1f6ab;	I mean, her best friend is having an epic meltdown right in front of her because he was dumped, and all she can think about is how soon she can kiss his ex-girlfriend????<br/>&#x1f6ab;	GOODNESS GRACIOUS. SAVE ME FROM THE POISON OF SUCH FAKE FRIENDS.<br/>&#x1f6ab;	Besides, the number of times she ‘swore to God’ made my head ache.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>•	<b>Abby Suso</b><br/><blockquote><br/>&#x1f6ab;	I used to think Abby was a decent character, and I didn’t exactly hate her as much as I hated Leah, but she came off as a flat character tbh.<br/>&#x1f6ab;	All the time we’re being told, Abby is the perfect girl on earth.<br/>&#x1f6ab;	<b>TOLD, NOT SHOWN</b><br/>&#x1f6ab;	The way she dumped Nick was bad, but I could understand her reasoning. <br/>&#x1f6ab;	What I couldn’t understand though, was her way of questioning her sexuality.<br/>&#x1f6ab;	This whole thing that goes like, I-am-not-bisexual-but-i-want-to-kiss-Leah-so-I-might-be was really confusing.<br/>&#x1f6ab;	And I wasn’t impressed by the way she avoided Nick and just left him hanging after her and not even caring, even if she <i>said</i> she did.<br/>&#x1f6ab;	I couldn’t care less though, because seriously, Abby’s character was underdeveloped and off-putting.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>•	The biggest problem for me with this book was the <b>bisexuality rep.</b> Yeah, it was important but the rep in this book seemed so unrealistic and forced I just couldn’t wrap my head around it.<blockquote><br/>&#x1f6ab;	In Simon Vs., we are introduced to Leah and Abby and they are the straightest people on Earth. But all of a sudden, Leah is bisexual and she has a HUGE crush on Abby and apparently she’s had a crush on her since forever.<br/>&#x1f6ab;	I mean, for someone whose face is so transparent, I can’t believe no one ever noticed it before? At least Simon must have said something, pried at her?<br/>&#x1f6ab;	It’s not like I didn’t know Leah was bisexual before reading this book. But I definitely didn’t doubt her heterosexuality in the previous book.<br/>&#x1f6ab;	After that, we’re again told Abby is bisexual and all of a sudden both of them are so in love with each other for no apparent reason.<br/>&#x1f6ab;	It felt to me as if Albertalli thought <u>‘Simon’s gay and everybody loves him, so why not make Leah gay too? Oh, she would need a love interest then. I could use Abby.’</u>  <br/>&#x1f6ab;	Like I said,<b> too unbelievable and forced romance,</b> it felt disgusting.</blockquote><br/><br/>•	All through the book Leah is so pumped up and hyper, and I never felt at ease while reading it. The whole book was supposed to be cute and happy and fluffy, but all the time I felt tense and stressed. <br/><br/>•	Because, Leah is just so incessantly nagging about everything. She doesn’t exactly whine throughout the book. <b>But according to her, </b><u>she has the suckiest life in the history of lives that sucked.</u><br/><br/>•	Btw Leah also objectifies her body? I mean I don’t understand girls and their feministic attitude. They are always on edge when men objectify women, but calling their body parts names is alright when <i>they</i> do it? Eek. <br/><br/>•	Speaking of women and bodies, this book was also supposed to deal with Leah being overweight. If that happened, I missed it entirely.<br/><br/>•	The not so subtle way Leah fought against racism was actually ridiculous. I don’t even know why. It was as if she didn’t know what racism was, but knew it was bad. No acknowledgement – a simple ‘you’re a racist’ and storming off. Typical Leah behavior. I shouldn’t have expected much.<br/><br/>•	<b>The inescapable Happily-Ever-After</b>. Good Lord, did I hate that ending! In the middle of utmost chaos and ridiculousness, the lovebirds kiss and unite, and leaving everything aside, leaving every single person hanging in the air, Becky takes us off to the final chapter where they live happily-ever-after.<br/><br/>•	Don’t you think I have a reason to be mad there? What happened to Garret that night? How about Nick? Did Leah forgive Morgan after all? When did Nick and Garret and the rest of the gang find out about them? Eh,<b> supporting characters have no role in the book when the lead pair are united </b>I guess.<br/><br/>•       Unrelatedly, there were so many pop culture/book references I had absolutely no idea about. This book was all about pleasing the fans. But Becky seems to have forgotten that not everyone has read all the books or watched all the hollywood movies or heard all those pop songs. Sorry, I felt irritated.<br/><br/><br/>Overall,<b> this book is nowhere as good as Simon Vs. The Homosapiens Agenda, and it totally does not deserve the hype.</b> I’m starting to think the five star reviews are all about nostalgia and pining for characters we thought were gone. <b>I really did not enjoy reading this book except for the Simon-Blue part, and since that was very little of what made this book, I don’t think I would’ve missed out on much if I hadn’t read it. </b>I’d hoped for something with real bisexual characters and a realistic approach from Beck Albertalli, but I guess authors are bound to disappoint sometimes, even the best ones.<br/><br/>Read it if you are blindly in love with the characters, and see how they disappoint you.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

But I loved how Bardugo decided to make her main character flawed – Alina Starkov is not brave. She is insecure, scared, and she is trying hard to belong somewhere, anywhere. Malyen Oretsev was a weak character, but I loved him, I just wish he had some charisma, something going for him that would’ve made us root for him. The Darkling – very intimidating, did exactly what Bardugo meant him to do. I absolutely loved Genya, she was awesome.<br/>But I don’t get why everyone’s all over The Darkling? I mean, he’s sexy,, and umm, intriguing. That’s it! All his good behavior was revealed to be a ruse to make Alina a slave and there ended my sympathy for him. Besides, Mal was <i>meant to be</i> with Alina, wasn’t he? I mean, childhood best friend, handsome, skilled. Ha!

He is also mentoring Aarohi, a highly talented singer. They fall in love. Aarohi ‘s songs become popular and she starts getting more attention. But she is willing to sacrifice her entire future to be with Rahul and help him overcome his alcohol addiction. Rahul realizes that he can neither leave alcohol nor leave Aarohi, he is the obstacle that blocks Aarohi from her promising future. He commits suicide, hoping she can move on without him and not waste her life nursing him.<br/><br/>Wondering why I am narrating this story? Because [b:The Retribution of Mara Dyer|15768409|The Retribution of Mara Dyer (Mara Dyer, #3)|Michelle Hodkin|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1417969205s/15768409.jpg|21474467] reminded me of the movie. <br/><br/><br/><b>Mara Dyer</b> is destructive. A danger to the world and the people she loves. On the other hand, <b>Noah Shaw</b> is a natural healer. He can save millions of people from their ailments. Both of them are madly in love with each other. But being with Mara negates Noah’s power, intensifying her own. <b>What do they chose to do?</b><br/><br/>I couldn’t help thinking of how both of the endings are inversely proportional and different and how it affects what happens next. <br/><br/>This book is wrong in many ways. Terribly wrong. I can see why the author chose to end the story the way she did, but it couldn’t stop me from thinking how wrong it was. Let me explain. <br/><br/><b>||Possible spoilers ahead||</b><br/><br/>Mara Dyer is <b><i>extraordinary</i></b> in the sense that, her ugliest, most destructive thoughts become true. Noah Shaw has an ability to heal himself and others in way medicines can never heal. There are others too – who can read people’s thoughts, who can make others do whatever they want, who can kill other people by self-harm…  <br/><br/>They try to figure out what is happening with them and why they are the way they are. It leads them to Dr.Kells, their supposed psychiatrist, who is experimenting on them. They find out that the abilities are genetic, activating or rather <i>manifesting</i> when they go through tough situations. It is a part of them, they’re not <i>broken</i>. And they cannot be cured, because there is nothing to be cured. So they embrace themselves for the way they are and move on.<br/><blockquote><br/><br/>● So much drama, yet so little plot.<b> This book was boring.</b><br/>● And <b>long. </b>Don’t forget long (and pretend I didn’t finish it in a day)<br/>● The first 75% of the book is literally the kids scouring through stacks of useless papers and files. <br/>● Or searching for them.<br/>● And I was lost for about 50% of it. <br/>● No, don’t blame me. It was foreign language.<br/>● I’m betting it was <i>unscience</i>. Idk.<br/>● Info dump like it's nobody's business. Also RIP SCIENCE. <br/>● So there is this guy Jamie who can manipulate people to do anything he wants, or believe anything he says. <br/>● That alone is so convenient and is just about the whole damn purpose of Jamie in this book.<br/>● Where the heck they got the money to do so much travelling was never mentioned.<br/>● They probably had Jamie talk through for them and got it all for free.<br/>● I’m so<b> frustrated</b> with that alone.<br/>● And Mara f-ing Dyer is so flat and useless and violent and <b><i>EVIL</i></b> I CANT EVEN<br/>● Noah was absent for 90% of this book, so ……, you know what I mean.<br/>● I can’t get why everything in the world revolves around Mara Dyer. Jamie looks at her like she’s a Goddess. Daniel follows her tail like she’s a precious stone. <br/>● While in fact, she’s a bloody freak who won’t accept she is, but goes on shaming those who are. WTF?!<br/>● Stella was the one and only stable-minded person in the whole damn book.<br/>● So well, obviously she had to go off because she wouldn’t get along with Mara.<br/>● Uh, and the should-have-blown-my-mind-and-shattered-me-to-pieces climax???<br/>● DON’T EVEN BOTHER.<br/>● The self-acceptance in this book is of the worst kind, please stay away.<br/>● And just the message is evil, please don’t profess this.<br/>● THE WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE WITHOUT THIS BOOK.<br/>● Btw half of the things that happened has no explanation. They are just treated as normal ya' know?<br/><br/><br/><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>In the end, it was just another happily-ever-after between two lovers who don’t even have a chemistry, who loves each other for no reason other than compulsion. Twilight much? Blah. Blah. I can’t express how disappointed I am with this book. It could have ended in a lot of different ways but it chose to end like this. That alone has left a scar on the image of Hodkins I had in mind.<br/><br/>So take my advice, <b>STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK<br/><br/>1.5/5 stars",,,1,,,0,,,,,

She is a talented singer, but never got on stage after a disastrous stage-fright incident in her second grade. Her best friend Soojin’s new attitude, and a new friendly addition to their cafeteria table, makes Amina insecure. With the new background of middle-school, Amina has to endure the test of friendship, an horrifying event at her community center, and also explore her faith in an unwelcoming place she calls her home. <br/><br/><u><b>Pros</u> -</b><br/><br/>•	<b>The writing style and narration </b>were comparably good, than the other diverse books out there.</b> Hena Khan’s voice is lucid and easy to read, which made the book even better.<br/><br/>•	<b>The exploration of cultural differences and morals </b>were done without a note of criticism, or cynicism. Amina is comfortable in her American culture, but she doesn’t go on about how her Pakistani parents are naïve and conservative.<br/><blockquote><i><br/>“Basketball?” Baba frowns. “No, no. Why basketball? Timothy next door tells me his son is captain of the chess team. You should do that.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>•	<b>Amina’s family was very relatable.</b> I loved that Hena Khan decided to show the inner aspects of a Muslim family. Amina’s relationship with her parents, and her brother felt very close to home.<br/><blockquote><i><br/>“I kind of want to tell him that I’m proud of him for making the team. And I wish he had been at dinner last night. But I don’t. We don’t say stuff like that to each other.”</i></blockquote><br/><br/>•	<b>The essence of a middle-grader and her insecurities were very well captured.</b> Hena Khan definitely understands perspective, and she makes sure to let her readers live along with her character.<br/><blockquote><i><br/>“Because even though I don’t know why, something about Soojin wanting to drop her name makes me worry that I might be next.”</i></blockquote><br/><br/>•	Her concerns about people not getting her name right, Super relatable!!<br/><br/>•	Amina’s mother is THE BEST.<br/><br/>•	And yeah, Bollywood reference. Or more specifically, <i><b>KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI </i>reference! </b> AAAAHHHH!!! It totally made my day.<br/><br/><b><u>Cons</u> -</b><br/><br/>So there was this important part of the story, about Amina and her music. <b>Hena Khan throws light on the acceptance of music in Islam, which is, like, super important. </b>But I’m not sure she addressed it in a proper way. Like, yeah, music is deemed haram generally, that is, unacceptable in Islam. Most people don’t buy into it because many sources states that music was practiced in the Prophet’s time. While others say that the Quran has stated music as unnecessary provocation and waste of time.<b> None of the cited sources are actually found to be reliable. But the novel states that music is acceptable, and a singer’s talent should be appreciated. </b>Now, I am not against that part, but I wanted the book to let the reader’s choose whether or not they want to believe whatever she says, rather than making a choice themselves. Because, a book is a big influence on a person’s life, so any Muslim reading the book might think that it is completely fine to listen to music and tempted to do it even if they hadn’t been into songs earlier. Like, I was super into songs sometime back, but when I learned that music <i>might</i> be haram, I stopped listening to it, not wanting to risk it, but now the book tells me otherwise.<b> I know, this is completely up to the person and his belief, but a book just cannot simply make its own laws on the behalf of religion. </b><br/><br/>Other than that, the book was completely enjoyable. It is important, and also it doesn’t misinterpret terrorism and islamophobia.<br/><br/><b>Overall, </b>this book provides a good look into the life of a normal Muslim family, a middle-grader trying to overcome her fears, and the importance of community, friendships and unity. Totally recommended. <br/>",,,1,Everyone,,0,,,,,

Or else Stiefvater and I are done.<br/><br/>When you pick up your first book by an insanely popular author, you naturally have some expectations. Or at least expect a good story. But this was bizarre and so Twilight-esque, I could hardly try convincing myself that it would end better.<br/> <b><br/>The only redeemable quality was the writing.</b> And the only reason I picked up this book in the first place was Sam, the male lead. He’s apparently my fictional boyfriend according to some Book Matchmaker challenge I took part in. Safe to say we’ve broken up. Or rather, I ditched him.<br/><br/><b>There are going to be **MINOR SPOILERS** ahead, but that shouldn’t matter because you aren’t going to read this book anyway amiright? </b><br/><br/>Let me give you a few reasons not to pick up this book –<br/><br/><b> 1. The Plot</b><br/><br/><blockquote>Grace was bitten by some wolves in the woods near her house when she was six. One of them supposedly saved her, and she has been in <i>love</i> with him ever since. Turns out, the wolf is not merely a wolf, but a werewolf. A boy in Grace’s class was murdered by the wolves, which puts them in imminent danger. Grace is overcome with a fiery need to protect them, especially <i>her</i> wolf, and find a way to stay with him forever.</blockquote><br/><br/>•	For some reason,<b> I had a really uncomfortable time reading this book.</b> At first I thought, it was because I wasn’t a fan of werewolves, but then I realized I had read and loved books on these shape shifters. Then I thought about the plot and it dawned on me how insanely <b>unrealistic and gross</b> it actually was.<br/><u> For six years, Grace is intrigued by a damn WOLF, even before she realized it was a werewolf.</u> OMG I’m puking.<br/><br/>•	Also, near to the end of the book, the plot takes this stupid turn, where the main characters search for a cure for werewolves to stop turning into wolves. The thing is, the werewolves in this book aren’t affected by moonlight, but rather by temperature changes. Cold temperature means wolf, warm means human. And the cure they come up with is THIS – inject the blood of a meningitis infected person to induce fever, and therefore - high temperature to the werewolf while they’re human. YOU DON’T EVEN NEED ME TO TELL YOU JUST HOW SICK AND GROSS AND STUPID AND DOWNRIGHT CRAZY THAT IS!!! Meningitis is very dangerous. Not to mention, contagious. And just transfusing some random blood from a stranger to three people.?? You should at least know some basic science kids! BIG PLOTHOLE THERE.<br/><br/>•	Like I said, the werewolves, while human, cannot stand cold temperatures without changing. Most of the book takes place in winter, or at night, while the temperature is low, so Sam and other werewolves are usually inside – rooms, cars, and the like. What felt weird to me was<b> the way Sam ran back and forth the cars and shops and houses. </b>Like, they would open the window slightly and he would start shivering, indicating change. But then, he would also open the door and run to the house, and even go on night excursions this way. It’s hard to explain, but<b> that looks utterly stupid in my imagination.</b> Like, open the door – run to the car – open door again – run to the shop. How cool is that? <br/><br/>•	Everything said, this book is once again, <b>a version of Twilight</b>. Minus the vampires. I would actually go ahead and say that<b> Twilight was better. </b>Because, Edward vs. Sam? <b>Edward.</b> He’s hotter. Bella vs. Grace? <b>Bella.</b> She’s tolerable at least. Edward-Bella vs. Sam-Grace? <b>Edward-Bella.</b> Better chemistry.<br/> Also, Twilight is better crafted than Shiver, because heck, where was the plot here? Even then, the similarities are uncanny.<br/><br/><b>2. The Characters</b><br/><br/>Eek. Firstly, I think even the humans here are inhuman. And the werewolves are just fine. There is just something NOT-Normal about these characters. They are all one-dimensional, in the truest sense of the word. Like, one person is assigned a certain trait which they carry off throughout the book. It is one of the factors that make this book flat and unfelt.<br/><br/>•	GRACE<br/><br/>One of the narrators, Grace is very unlikeable. She is hardcore obsessed by the wolves in the woods near her house, even when they become the reasons for one of her classmates death! <u>Heck, she even blames that guy for dying, because it put <i>her </i>dear wolves in <i>danger</i> of being hunted down by the police. </u>WT*?<br/><br/>She is also rude to her parents, her best friends, and to just about everyone in general except Sam. For an instance, Isabel was so friendly to her, but she never ever considered her the same way. She never says SORRY, even when she’s wrong. And her love-at-first-sight is just creepy and sick. She also wants to turn into a werewolf, she <i>regrets</i> not changing. Huh, seriously? Why not let Sam or someone else bite you then?<br/><br/>•	SAM<br/>The second narrator, Sam is a confusing character. I mean, he is not unbearable. Certainly not as much as Grace. And his creepy obsession with Grace seems far more reasonable. But his characterization was pathetic. His tone felt like a girl’s. He could have been Samantha for all I know. And the attempt to make him Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes didn’t work with me either.  <br/><br/>•	ISABEL<br/>The only likeable character for me. She was quirky, witty, charming at times, and her keen nature made me like her instantly. But she too suffers from the one-dimensional plague that has infected all our characters. And yet, Isabel makes you root for her.<br/>The rest of the characters aren’t even that developed that I can write about. For example, Jack and Beck were mentioned so many times but we got to see them very rarely it makes you feel like they’re not even there. At least, they are spared from my critics. Good for them.<br/><br/><b>3. The Romance</b><br/><br/>Not worth it. Just not worth it. Haven’t read of such a creepy disturbing romance in recent times. Oh yes, they made a cute pair, probably. But their insta-love and romance weren’t droolworthy or anything romantic, only <b>disgusting.</b> <br/>I don’t know what my problem with it is. I was even okay with Bella and Jacob, but here the context is different, the world id different, the werewolves are different. It just makes me sick to think of a girl romancing a boy who was essentially destined to turn into and die a wolf. Oh no. NO.<br/><br/><b>4. The Writing</b><br/><br/>It’s witty and sarcastic. And pleasant to read. Also, fitting for the atmospheric setup of the book. Not exceptional by any means, though you can feel the potential. But even the generic writing style couldn’t save the non-existent plot.<br/><b><br/><br/>Even after all this, you still want to read this book, I say go for it. If you’re a die-hard fan of Twilight, I say go for it. Else if you’re any bit like me and cannot tolerate any form of bestiality, I say, don’t approach this book at all. Stay 10 feet away from it ALWAYS. Yeah? Yeah.<br/><br/>",,,2,,,0,,,,,

Robert|https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1358624643p2/459760.jpg] has undoubtedly become my go-to author when I want to read something homely. <br/>Not that the book is a literary genius or anything, but it stays true to its roots, and that is what matters the most in diverse books.<br/><br/><b><u>THE PLOT</b></u><br/><br/>Farhana and Faraz are twins. Their family, native to Pakistan, has been settled in the UK for the past few years. Being a Muslim in their schools is a lot difficult than it sounds. As the holy month of Ramadan approaches, with a little prodding from their religious Aunt Najma, both of them wants to incorporate their faith into their life. At first it seems easy. But then Farhana’s past relationship with Malik, and Faraz’s friendship with Skrooz, the drug dealer – all catches up on them. <br/><br/>The real struggle against external temptations and the inescapable consequences of an unhealthy relation, are all showcased wonderfully in this novel.<br/><br/><b><u>Pros</u> - </b><br/><br/>■•<b>The relatable parts of the book – 100%</b>. Seriously, every event and every incident and every single aspect of Farhana’s life was so damn relatable and it touched me on a very personal note. It was like seeing me in the book. Like, reading a book on me?<br/>	》The pressure of a conservative family.<br/>        》Especially a Muslim family and their   stereotypes against girls.<br/>	》How Farhana had an entirely different personality at school, from how she is at home.<br/>	》The ‘accepting without questioning’ mentality of every single Muslim girl out there.. ARGHHH<br/>	》No one has said it better.<br/><br/>■•<b>This book sheds some light on THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CULTURAL VERSION OF RELIGION AND ACTUAL RELIGION.</b> <br/>	》THAT, my friends, <u>is something that needs worldwide attention.</u><br/>	》People think Girls are oppressed in some parts of the world, because they wear a Burqa. That Muslim girls who don’t wear them, are liberals. <br/>	》In fact, those apparently ‘oppressed’ girls are only practicing their religion. <br/>	》IT IS YOUR OWN CHOICE WHETHER YOU DECIDE TO FOLLOW THE WAY OF DRESSING YOUR RELIGION PRESCRIBES. <br/>	》It does not make you any less ‘oppressed’ than the nuns who cover themselves, than the monks who wear whatever they wear. It’s not oppression; it’s a comfort, a means of security.<br/>	》No religion forces a way of life on their followers. It only suggests the best way to do things. AND IT GIVES YOU A CHOICE.<br/><br/>■•<b>It focuses on Ramadhan</b>. The holy month is heavily under-represented in Islamic books, fiction or not.<br/>	》The Ramadhan preparation – cleaning every nook and corner of the house – OH YES!! And I thought it happened only in our place lol<br/>	》The very real struggle of waking up for <i>sehri</i>, the meal before dawn.<br/>	》And the importance of the month is portrayed really well too.<br/>	》Also, the inner peace and happiness after the long Tarawih prayers. That’s some real stuff!<br/><br/>■•The <b>cultural and age differences in ethnics and religious practices</b> as well as the <b>lack of understanding between the age gaps</b> are very vividly outlined.<br/>	<br/>■•It also gives you a brilliant look at the lives of veiled Muslim women. A woman in veil does not mean that she is a pitiful, oppressed girl. The real person behind the veil might be as much or even more rebellious and outgoing than you are. We have seen and read books on the poor women in veils. <b>This book was quite a refreshing, warming tale of how a woman wearing niqab isn’t just an illiterate lesser mortal than anyone else.</b><br/><br/>■•The very real struggle of following your religion vs. falling for external temptations. Uff. Farhana and Faraz’s story is an exemplar.<br/><br/>■•EVERY OTHER MENTION OF ART STOLE MY HEART.<br/><br/><b><u>Cons</u> - </b><br/><br/>■•This book had <b>a very subtle hint of racism.</b> As in, Farhana expressively hints that her parents are racist, but she herself wasn’t far behind on judging people by their color. (It isn’t very noticeable though, and the author never might’ve intended that way at all).<br/><br/>■•All the time, we are told that Farhana is this brilliant person.<b> TOLD not SHOWN.</b> (Excpet for the one time she argued with her teacher. THAT WAS BRILLIANT).<br/><br/>■•I have a justifiable hatred towards comparing people’s voices to food items. <i>Sounded like melted chocolate</i>? How does that sound? Try eating your own voices the next time sweet tooth strikes?<br/><br/>■•This stupid love triangle, which was more like, a line and a dot. BUT STILL.<br/><br/>■•Seems like Na’ima Robert has a knack for overtly dramatizing her books.<br/><br/>■•She just has to include every YA cliché’s possible. <br/><br/>■•It couldn’t have ended any other way I suppose, but, SAY NO TO CLICHÉ YA TROPES!<br/><br/>■•Lastly,<b> I hate that cover!</B> haha.<br/><br/>Anyways, you gotta give this book a chance if you’re looking for a book to enlighten you on Islamic practices without being preachy. The book has romance elements too, if that’s sort of your thing. Otherwise, I wouldn’t say the story was great or anything, but it is an important one, and I swear I’m gonna buy this book for my kids when they’re 12.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

But never did it mention how morally wrong these subjects were.<br/>•	Also, <b>TERMINAL ILLNESS AND SUICIDE</b>. Two other important topics that I feel could have been portrayed better. Extinguishing all hopes of proper life and encouraging self-harm may give off wrong vibes to some readers.<br/>•	It’s not the story in itself that’s wrong, but the way it is treated. <br/><br/><b><u>I would never recommend this book to people suffering from/been victims of terminal illness, sexual abuse, drug addiction.</u></b> Even if they can relate to this book, I’m afraid it would rub them in the wrong direction.<br/><br/>All-in-all, this book was an entirely new experience for me, an eye-opener, and life-changing.

And how completely functional organs and limbs I have attached to my body. Shamefully, it took me more than 300 books and 18 years of life to come to this realization. In my defense though, I wasn’t really <i>actually </i>aware of how things are different for some people, and how that difference is normal to them.<br/><br/>See,<b> The Art of Feeling</b> is a good book. It is about Samantha ‘Sam’, who is handicapped after an accident that killed her Mom, and Eliot, who has<b><i> Congenital Insensitivity to Pain with Anhidrosis.</b></i> Basically, Sam is in pain all the time, while Eliot can never feel pain at all. Being two outcasts in a school full of bullies, it is normal that they seek each other’s company. And be the constant recipient of bullying. Both of them have dysfunctional families, broken lives and heart that desire to live. Also feelings that isn’t mutual. Time and empathy are the only things that helps to heal, and Sam and Eliot realizes that by being there for each other.<br/><br/>So like really, its different. I haven't heard of other books that deals with these themes. Rare disease, bullying, drugs..<br/><br/><b><u>TRIGGER WARNING:</u> Bullying, Drug dealing</b><br/><br/><b><u>MY THOUGHTS</B><s> which I am not making up at all because I read this book decades ago</s></u><br/>•	Quirky yes, but insta-love? <b>Turn off.</b><br/>•	Mentions Myer’s Briggs Personality Types and Art.

(Idk what absurd planet that name came from, but its cute :)<br/>•	And omg this - <blockquote><b><i><br/>“That is the ugliest thing I’ve ever seen,”says Eliot. “When did you take it out of the dryer?”<br/>“It’s my dog,” I grumble.<br/>“That’s a dog?” He recoils.</i></b></blockquote><br/>•	Eliot is cute and funny sometimes, without meaning to be.<br/>•	Idk, but <b>his character is something like I’ve never read before.</b> Not particularly sticking to your mind but not forgettable either. I still remember everything about him even if it’s been weeks since I read the book. See?<br/><blockquote><b><i><br/>“. . . . but if I’m going to die for a cause, I’d like it to be furniture.”<br/></i></b></blockquote><br/>•	Sorry, but only those who read the book would get that quote ;)<br/>•	And the totally realistic way this book deals with accident. Is. Blowing.<b><i><blockquote><br/>“People who think flaxseed oil will make them immortal should be warned: it’s not worth it. Switch to junk food like my dad.

Arghhh.<br/>•	But the portrayal of friendship is not commendable. The way Sam treated her other friends and all.<br/>•	Anyway the ending wasn’t blowing.<br/>•	Kinda predictable really. But the twist is appreciated.<br/><br/>All in all, you should read this book if you love contemporary and if you don’t like contemporary YA. This book certainly sets a new agenda of its own.

I liked this one better and I’m more curious to read the next book than I had been when I finished the first one. Though that might be because I ventured into this with no expectations at all. And that technique worked. <i>*applaudes self* </i><br/><br/><b><u>PLOT</B></U><br/><br/>America Singer, one of the six girls left in The Selection, and the only one of caste five, is not sure if she is ready to pursue the crown. She has to decide between her long-time sweetheart Aspen, and Prince Maxon, who has made it clear that she is his only choice. But obliging to America’s request of needing time, Maxon decides to extend the selection and give other girls a chance. <br/><br/>On the day of her presentation of philanthropy project report, America speaks against the need to abandon the caste system. The report is cut short, the king is furious and rebels break out.  America must finally choose – going home to the life she has always known, or stay at the palace and try to reform the country.<br/><br/><B><U>MY THOUGHTS</B></U><br/><br/>□ <b>It was good to see some action finally, </b>but still I hated the fact that we didn’t get to witness it. Everything that goes on with the rebels is narrated third-person, and that strips us of the satisfaction of actually being there while it happens.<br/><br/>□ <b>I had many issues with America Singer.</b> The author’s desperate attempts at making us love her is one of the main reasons I don’t feel like it. Otherwise, she is fairly lovable. But her modesty and cluelessness regarding herself, is frustrating. The love triangle is interesting, but there needs to be boundaries. In one chapter she’s all sure about Maxon, and in the very next, Aspen’s words melts her to puddle.<br/><br/>It was also annoying to wait her out, while she makes up her mind on whether she’s suitable for the crown or not. <br/><br/>□ I feel the whole story, THE WHOLE OF IT, from book 1 to book 5, could have been a single book. It is just a simple story, which is dragged out so much; it makes me want to scream. How long do I have to wait till she just takes up the crown and becomes the princess? (Because obviously, she is going to be the One duh) It’s pure torture -_-<br/><br/>□ <b>Maxon.</b> He’s the best thing to happen to this book. I really feel America doesn’t deserve such a gentleman. No, he’s not willing to throw his position as a prince and rebel against the republic, but he is still willing to bring a change once he is beyond his father’s grasp. And I totally agree with him being with the other girls, because AMERICA is one selfish girl. She wants Maxon all for herself, but she also wants Aspen and his familiar warmth. But when Maxon goes out with another girl, she becomes green with envy. FOR GOD’S SAKE, MAXON IS WAITING FOR HER!! IT’S NOT LIKE SHE HAS NO CHOICE. HE IS JUST WAITING, TO MAKE SURE SHE TOTALLY AGREES. BUT SHE BEING THE DAMNED GIRL SHE IS, IS NOT READY TO TAKE THE CROWN! I mean what the hell?? If you think you can’t be the princess, just get the hell out of the palace without sulking around wasting other people’s precious time. THIS GIRL IS SO ANNOYING AND SO NOT-ANNOYING AT THE SAME TIME. DAMN -_-<br/><br/><b>All said, I would definitely like to read the next book, just because it is comforting and frustrating to read about America’s turmoil. And be as it may, <s>I think we’re both similar in some ways</s> which is probably why I have such contrasting feeling towards her. AND I LOVE TO WORK UP MY EMOTIONS TIME AND AGAIN SO THERE.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Hale never did fail his promise to surprise her every day, and Ean is ready to be a gentleman. But the thing with the heart is that, it never does go in the right direction.<br/> Eadlyn must make sure she can secure her crown, the people’s love and a husband whom she can love and for that, she has to make an impossible choice. Who is going to be The One? <br/><br/><u>MY THOUGHTS</U><br/>I never did expect much to happen in this book, and I never expected such <b>disappointment</b> either. The story was way too<b> predictable. </b>I saw the end coming miles away. The<u><b> writing wasn’t</u></b> all that <b><u>good</b></u> either. <br/><br/>As for Eadlyn Schreave, I have no idea how she became an <i><b>overnight saint</i></b>.  The character development which was supposed to be gradual seemed to have caught an airbus. Her sudden compassion and change of heart toward the suitors were just too fast. And please, I know Maxon and America are in love - I HAVE READ THREE WHOLE BOOKS ABOUT IT - I DON’T WANT TO BE REMINDED THEY STILL ARE IN LOVE EVERY OTHER CHAPTER! <br/><br/>Also, may I ask <b>where was Ahren, Kaden and Osten or even Aunt May all the time?</b> Because the first person I know would respond to America’s heart attack (besides Maxon) would surely be May. But no, these people, who are important family members, are seen in what, like, one chapter? Or make that one page -.-<br/><br/>So let’s talk about The Selection now. For half the book, I wasn’t even aware it was taking place. <b>The characters felt bland, and undeveloped.</b> And the winner! That is the part which was most disappointing. Even though I wasn’t really rooting for any of the boys, Eadlyn’s choice <spoiler>Erik?</b></spoiler> was totally predictable and very unwise. And the way Henri reacted to it was, like, WHAT? DID YOU EVEN LOVE HER BOY?? <b>Things were very unrealistic.</b> The so-called romance was non-existent. One thing I liked though, was the thing about Hale and Ean. <spoiler>They’re gay and in love </spoiler><br/><br/>Let me tell you, I actually wanted a nice, cute memorable ending as in The One, but the ending felt as if the author was rushed to meet a deadline. <b>It was too much, and too soon</b> – the after-effects we don’t even get to see. I don’t know, I just thought it would be better. <br/><br/><u>VERDICT</u><br/>I really wished I had stopped at The One, because it was a perfect ending to America’s story. Eadlyn’s story was short of depth and emotion, and in the end, it didn’t work for me.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It’s one of those books which carries a powerful message, wows you with the amount of work put on it by the author, introduces some memorable characters, and yet you find a missing piece in the puzzle.<br/><br/><b>Salt to The Sea is set in Nazi Germany.</b> Many books have been written during the time, including one of my absolute <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19063.The_Book_Thief?ac=1&from_search=true"">favorites.</a> But it also brings to light, the sinking of The <b>Wilhem Gustloff</b> which is one of the biggest maritime tragedy in history, and yet I only knew about it through this book. Ruta Sepetys gives us a wider perspective, narrating through four people’s point of view. <br/><br/><b>Florian</b> is a young guy, who’s exceptional at forgery, carrying with him the weight of a secret. <b>Joana </b>is a nurse, striving to help others recover while struggling to survive herself.<b> Emilia</b> has lost it all, her Dad, Mom, homeland. And now she has only one little hand to hold onto, which she clutches to her heart with all her remaining strength.<b> Alfred,</b> an aspiring German soldier, gaining strength from the mental letters he writes to his beloved back at home, wants to prove himself by working for a cause he feels is RIGHT.   <br/>This book is the journey of these four people, how they come together and fall apart, in a world that is crumbling, straying to stay right.<br/><br/><u><b>The Writing</b></u> - though not exceptional by any means, fits the story just right. The narrative was a really clever move by the author in my opinion. Ruta Sepetys succeeds in showing us completely different perspectives of people in war. The innocence, the cruelty, the unfairness of it all, and most of all THE HUMANITY still left in this world. <br/><br/><u><b>The CHARACTERS</b></u> - The character buildup is brilliant. Such complexity, such background. How all of them came together in this story is what I loved the most. But even though, I love them so much, the characters were still <b>one-dimensional. </b>It was like watching them through a looking glass. We don’t really form an emotional bond with them. It’s not about the relatability. It’s more like the distance, between us and them. You get me? Sepetys’s characters are intense and complex, but not deep. The emotional development was missing; rather, it was a matter of mind. <br/><br/><b>A cleverly weaved out story of fictional characters. </b>It’s like Sepetys rehearsed her characters so much and put them out to act on the play, but the characters forgot to be themselves. I hope that makes sense? <br/>Lets explore the characters – <br/><br/>•	<b>Florian</b><br/><blockquote><b><i> “Fear is a hunter.”</i></b></blockquote><blockquote><br/>My favorite. This reserved, introverted, artistic character had an important role in the book. From his shy, private demeanor to his carefully constructed lies, and caring nature, Florian is the best example of how war ages people prematurely.<br/> At just seventeen, Florian has the heavy weight of a top national secret on his baggage, and has already been on the ‘wanted” board. Plus, the insta-love, which just fell right. The only character I could actually feel for. I wished his story was a little more elaborated though.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>•	<b>Joana</b><br/><blockquote><b><i> “Guilt is a hunter.”</i></b></blockquote><blockquote><br/>Persistence and humanity is displayed simultaneously through this character. Joana grew up with rich parents - practicing medicine - in the land of Lithuania. When war erupts, she is forced to flee to Germany. Overcome by guilt and regret, Joana becomes compelled to save whoever comes her way, treating them, saving lives, as much as she can, in hopes that redemption can wash away the guilt written in her forehead.</blockquote><br/><br/>•	<b>Emilia</b><br/><blockquote>Oh yes, quite possibly the best character in this book. Being sent away by parents who were concerned for her safety was one thing, but being sent away again from fake parents was a heartbreak. Enduring too much shame and sadness in her 16 years of life, than we would ever experience in a lifetime, Emilia is the epitome of goodness, sacrifice and strength in a weak body. Yes, her story was heartbreaking.</blockquote><br/><br/>•	<b>Alfred</b><br/><blockquote>Every tale needs an antihero. But Alfred is not quite that. Through Alfred’s story, Sepetys shows us a complete different side of the war. Supporting Hitler and his ideologies with his own twisted righteousness, Alfred is going to make you think. Not all villains tried to be villainy. Some just became that way on the journey to become a hero. </blockquote><br/><br/>The supporting characters were also very well developed and significant to the story. And it is also one of those rare books where you don’t get overwhelmed by the number of characters and their stories, because each of them is unique.<br/><br/><br/><b>This book is definitely one of the best works of fiction dealing with Nazi Germany and the effects of War. </b>The research work by the author is praiseworthy. The characters may as well have been real. If not for the feeling that the author forgot to let her characters live their own life, it would have been a five-star read.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

With an<b> utterly boring plot and undeveloped characters,</b> How I Live Now makes you wonder bleakly about how you actually are living while reading the book – <b>lifelessly.</b> I sure as hell didn’t expect much from the book, and even without the added burden, this book somehow managed to disappoint the hell outta me. <br/><br/>Well, for starters, Elizabeth – Daisy – who is the narrator, goes to live with her aunt and cousins whom she had never ever seen before, all the way across to England. Life with them was going really well for her, with the added drama of romance with Edmund, one of her dreamy-eyed cousins. The act of incest is well received by her other cousins. Unfortunately, a war erupts in London, which in turn affects their whole life. <blockquote><br/>•	The characters had zero potential, <b>no personality.</b><br/>•	The narrative was too dragged and there were literally<b> no conversations, dialogues. </b><br/>•	THAT, I realize, is something I can’t live without in books.<br/>•	It was indicated many times that Daisy’s cousins had some sort of mental power, but<b> no explanations or descriptions were made.</b><br/>•	Again, Daisy has to be the<b> most boring character</b> I’ve ever had the unfortunate fate to meet in fiction.<br/>•	This book was written with war in mind.<br/>•	Because nothing else happens, other than the constant mention of war in the background.<br/>•	The gruesome detailing of broken limbs and detached arms were added for pity’s sake I guess.<br/>•	The narrator of the audiobook expressed exactly <b>ZERO emotions.</b></blockquote><br/>•	It goes without saying that I felt exactly the same way throughout the book. -_-<br/><br/>I can’t go on in my life speaking of this nonsense book. One of those literal ‘masterpieces’ I am not going to lay my eyes on, ever again.<br/><br/>P.S I hear it has won a Michael Printz Honor.<br/><br/>God bless me and my reading tastes. <br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The only one who knows that about him has no idea who he is.

Only, <b>both of their identities are anonymous </b>by virtue of fake names and internet. </p><br/><br/><b>UNTIL, another guy discovers it.</b> Simon’s secret is out when Martin chances upon his open inbox, and Martin takes the chance to blackmail him into getting him a chance with Abby, one of Simon’s best friends. Torn between setting up a stupid guy for his popular friend, and the horror of his sexuality coming out, Simon has a lot of things weighing him down. Add to it, the pressure of his parents’ ‘big deals’, his friends being upset with him, and Blue seeming suddenly uninterested, Simon has one hella life. <br/><br/><b><u>THOUGHTS</u></b><br/><blockquote><br/>•	The prospect of having an anonymous listener to all the rambling of your stupid brain is like, <b>delightful.</b><i> freaking</i> delightful.<br/>•	Blue is awesome.<br/>•	Those emails were so damn good and relatable.<br/>•	All the references to Harry <i>freaking</i> Potter. <br/><blockquote><br/><b><i> “It’s a dementor robe over my clothes.

Ah. Such satisfaction.<br/>•	Also Oreos. Can’t forget the Oreos. I’m dead.<br/>•	Is it possible to smile to death?<br/>•	The insides of these kids’ brain are literally an expansion of my own.<br/>•	And <u>the family, the relationships.</u><br/>•	A FURRY, WOOLY ADORABLY GOOD BALL OF WARMTH AND CUTENESS.<br/>•	I know that was cheesy. Just saying.<br/>•	‘who-is-Blue’ guessing never got me anywhere.<br/>•	I stopped guessing a long time back.<br/>•	Because, Blue was <i>freaking</i> amazing in those emails, I didn’t want to ruin him for me by him showing up in person.<br/>•	But damn, he was even more cute, adorable and shy and lovely in person.<br/>•	Wait, I can’t seem to get over the fact that this school has like, zero bad kids??<br/>•	I mean an effed up tumblr post for three days, and no one gives a damn??!<br/>•	That’s so freaking unrealistic. <br/>•	Never mind.<br/>•	Leah is the fictional version of my bff.<br/>•	I’ll have to gift this book to her.<br/>•	I can’t really believe how easily and conveniently everything happens to Simon. <br/>•	Like, this book is the definition of happiness and goodies don’t get me wrong.<br/>•	But I expected a bit more drama, <i>stuff</i> to happen.<br/>•	And Abby, Nick and everyone else who makes an appearance in this book, stole my <i>freaking</i> heart.<br/>•	The highly appropriate usage timing of FREAKING in this book is impossible.<br/>•	It’ll take me some time to get over it.<br/>•	That ending was sunshine on my dark eyes. <br/>•	Love, Simon. <br/>•	Can we please applaud???<br/></blockquote><br/><b>Anyway, </b> this was too cute to be true, with little story, highly entertaining characters and a smooth, fun writing style. Almost all the characters felt girlish. The hype is true in sense of characters, but this book, imo, neither does it have much appeal in terms of realism, nor in the terms of mind-blowing-sensations.<br/><b>Pick it up when you need to feel good.

This, in my opinion, is not true. And I’m not talking about physical strength. Just that nature has made one gender more powerful than the other. And clearly, in the case of human beings, it’s the male gender.<b> But with power come arrogance and an impulse to dominate over the others.</b> We aren’t weak actually, we the women population. We are strong in our own way. But men always have had the upper hand. And that has led to unequal consideration towards women.

The girls at East Rockport High have always been accustomed to the variety of sexist jokes and games the boys come up with. Like, the<u> bump-n-grab game</u> scheduled for Valentine’s Day, the<u> March Madness</u>, which is basically an online poll for boys where they select the<u> most-fuckable-girl</u> of the year. The administration doesn’t find these acts punishable but they always have these dress-code-checks few times a year that applies only for girls. <br/>Having enough of this sexism, and inspired by The Riot Grrrl Movement her mother was actively part of, Vivian decides to start <b>Moxie</b>, a feministic zine, anonymously. At first the response is barely there. But then more and more girls come up, eager to fight for rights they deserve. Fighting with the rock-headed principal and staff is hard, but MOXIE GIRLS MUST FIGHT BACK.<br/><br/><b><u>THOUGHTS</b></u><br/><br/>This was literally the first page of the book – <br/><blockquote><i>For all the teenage women fighting the good fight.<br/>And for my twelfth-grade Current Topics teacher for calling me a feminazi in front of the entire class.

While in a sense, it may be true, you could also argue against it. It has a lot of possibilities for an amusing, thought-provoking debate.  <br/>Look at this – <br/><br/>	●<blockquote><b><i>“A man does not come to the almshouse or the jail by the tyranny of fate or circumstance, but by the pathway of groveling thoughts and base desires. Nor does a pure-minded man fall suddenly into crime by stress of any mere external force; the criminal thought had long been secretly fostered in the heart, and the hour of opportunity revealed its gathered power.”</i></b></blockquote><br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, I was reminded of Jean Val Jean while reading this sentence. Not surprised if you did too. We all have loved that character, who, out of sheer desperation to feed his family, stole a piece of bread and ended up in prison. Theft is a crime, no matter what they say, but feeding your family is not. Bringing up this fictional scenario to point out that Allen is wrong, is not my intention though. I’d rather you think of all the poor people there, who were tried and tested in court, many sentenced to death, because they did something similar, or worse. Does that justification make them any less guilty? No. But does that knowledge lessen your hatred for the said accused? Admit it, it did. <br/><br/>	●<blockquote><b><i>""Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself”</blockquote></b></i><br/><br/>So what does that say about the person’s thoughts? Had he always harbored ill thoughts, thought of stealing, killing, murdering? He might have. Could he have avoided those thoughts if he willed himself hard enough? The answer is <b>NO</b>. Point blank. <br/><br/>However hard we try, a controlled mind always slips, always blends in with its surroundings, because just like a coin with two sides, a mind is composed of bad thoughts as much as the good ones. We may think bad stuff, and will ourselves not to do it. But when we actually do something bad, it is NOT BECAUSE WE HAD THOUGHT OF IT ONCE BEFORE. Of course, it is just what I feel to be true, you may have arguments that I may counter-argue. Still, <b>I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE COMPLETE CONTROL OF ONES’ MIND BY ONES’ SELF, IS NOT POSSIBLE.</B><br/><br/>	●<BLOCKQUOTE><B><I> ""A man cannot directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly, yet surely, shape his circumstances”</I></B></BLOCKQUOTE><br/><br/>That, my friends, I whole-heartedly disagree with. <b>You can choose to be good or bad, but you definitely cannot choose to <i>think</i> good thoughts or bad thoughts.</b> Duh. Try it for yourself if you don’t believe me.<br/><br/>	●<blockquote><i> “Change of diet will not help a man who will not change his thoughts. When a man makes his thoughts pure, he no longer desires impure food.”</i></blockquote><br/>I mean, seriously? What someone eats is his own business, you idiot. Even if you eat a snake, or a man for that matter, your body will adjust unless there are other ways for survival. Alright?<br/><br/>	●<blockquote><b><i>""The will to do springs from the knowledge that we can do. Doubt and fear are the great enemies of knowledge, and he who encourages them, who does not slay them, thwarts himself at every step.""</i></b></blockquote><br/><br/>However impressive the above sentence might be, I can’t think of confining the whole of human behavioral pattern and thoughts to such a simple conclusion. One does not simply NOT DO things because he thinks he can’t. An ordinary human being, being a social creature, considers a lot many more factors rather than the simple ignorant fact that he can’t do what he wants to. I couldn’t vouch enough for how wrong that statement is. Yeah, I have come across such phrases before - “Nothing is impossible”, “You can’t do it if you think you can’t”. And no, I haven’t questioned them before, because they were meant in a motivational context. But reading Allen’s work, where he analyses human mind, and spreads out reasons why we’re all doing it all wrong ‘mentally’, I had to say it. <br/>And I don’t mean to be demotivating. If you are inspired by this work, that’s a good thing, go on with your life. But if you are anything like me, you might be criticizing the book too, and I’m merely contributing my opinions.<br/><br/>	●<blockquote><b><i> “ALL that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts”</i></b></blockquote><br/><br/>Please don’t get me started on this one again. A man simply doesn’t fail because he thought them all wrong. And a man wouldn’t conquer the world with his stupid domineering thoughts. <br/><br/>	●<blockquote><b><i>“To desire is to obtain; to aspire is to, achieve.”</i></b></blockquote><br/>You get that? <b>It’s the same thing over and over again.</b> I’m amazed he managed to stretch it out for a full 65 pages. That’s impressive vocabulary skills. Blah.<br/><br/>This one might be the truest thing he said, but it is not a fact at all. It doesn’t work in all situations. Like those physics theories we were forced to learn in high school? Applies to some places but doesn’t run true for the rest. <br/>	<blockquote><b>The strength of the effort is the measure of the result.</b></blockquote><br/><br/>All in all, I get that while James Allen tried some old-school motivational lines, (okay, maybe he is the master of those ‘old-school’ motivational lines. This was published in what? 1902?), it didn’t work with me. That might be because I’m unmoved by non-fiction and motivational pieces in general, so you may still want to read this book. And yet, I say,<b> “A man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts.”  - NOT.",,,1,,Sharjeel,0,,,,,

The way she has managed to capture the shallow mindset of Indian villagers is new to me. Not many Indian writers try to write out so honestly about their culture and way of life. That is another reason, why this book might appeal more, only to Indian readers. The characters of Anupama and Anand teach us a lesson or two. The <b>character development</b> that takes place within these 150 pages is amazing. And the topic of Vitiligo was handled well, but I do feel, the ‘untold’ story of the rest of the characters should also have been assessed. In the midst of it all, Sudha Murty herself profusely displays her ‘standard’ Indian nature, with the descriptions of beauty and wealth as a domineering aspect of one’s life. <b>Quite hypocritical actually</b>.<br/><br/><b>Either way, </b> this wasn’t a remarkable book, neither am I going to remember the characters for much long.

I've been thinking of reading Danielle Steele books just to see what all the hype was about. Now I'm not sure I would want to read any of her books ever again. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the book wasn't thaaat bad, but it was just not good. It was in no way realistic, or original. The story lacked the relatability we so badly look for when we read non-fantasy-type stories. Yeah, it's fiction, but I don't think anything as dumb as what happens in the book would happen even in the fictional world.<br/><br/>For starters, five kids Izzie, Gabby, Billy, Sean and Andy meet on the first day of kindergarten, and they grow up together up until they graduate - together? Really, don't kids grow up to have different tastes and personalities? And even weirder, these kids go on to become what they dream of becoming in childhood. Yea, it does happen, but all of them? Everything just happens to this group of friends. Seriously, I have never heard of dumber coincidences. And then, the friendship starts hindering when each of them are killed, one-by-one in different ways - accident, drug dealing, suicide. And what happens to the two who are left together? They make out. Hah! What happened to the years of friendship then? <br/><br/>In the beginning, Izzie was my favorite character, but at the end, the author screwed her up so badly, I wasn't even sure why I liked her in the first place. She sleeps with two of her best friends, Andy and Sean, just because. Thank heavens, the third boy Billy, was committed, or else I guarantee he would also have been laid out. <br/><br/>And they say, Izzie is the most reasonable of the five. Really.? I'd think Gabby was better. She at least had the right mind to stick with one person throughout. That sounds more reasonable that going for a one-night stand with two best friends. <br/><br/>The book did have plus points, it shows accurately how death of someone affects the people close to them. But it's also exaggerated, and unrealistic, predictable halfway through, and does no justice to the title. <br/><br/>I'm so not going to read this ever again. Thank you very much!

Just because the protagonist is some 10 years old? Huh, How about marking The Book Thief as middle-grade then? The Nest is more of a magical realism story, and I wouldn’t recommend it for kids.<br/><br/><b>Despite what the cover and title makes you believe, The Nest is not some spooky mystery. </b><br/><br/>It is told through the pov of Steven. Steven has a sister Nicole and both of them are excited when Mom and Dad brings home a little baby brother, Theo. But Theo is not completely fine, it seems. He has to undergo surgeries for heart problems which make Steve’s parents busy, going in and out of the hospital. One day Steve is stung by a wasp from the nest in their courtyard. That night, Steven dreams of an angelic wasp who promises to replace their<i> ‘faulty’</i> brother Theo with a new perfect baby boy they’re <i>‘constructing’ </i>in their nest. Steve dismisses the dream at first, but later on the Queen Wasp’s predictions come true, making him realize it was for real. Realizing he has made faulty promises, Steve is determined to save their baby brother from the wasps. <br/><br/><br/><b>My first and foremost problem with the book is the plot itself.</b> The author might have had good intentions of showcasing a big brother fighting alone to save his little brother. But the premise and the plotline don’t do much justice. Steven and Nicole lack a child’s innocence and curiosity. The insecurities of children with busy parents are also unreasonably portrayed. The whole climax scene was lengthy and the action felt forced. There were some incidents though<spoiler> like with the knifeman’s phone call</spoiler> which were quite interesting. But the<b> overall story was boring to me.</b> For whatever reasons, <b>this book would not appeal to older audiences.</b> At the same time, the subject is kind of inappropriate for younger audiences too. <br/><br/>Like I said, in one word, <b>weird</b>. Nothing like I have read before, definitely not what I expected. What makes it a 3-star read was the narration of the audiobook by Gibson Frasier. Otherwise, it is safe to skip this book.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

This book was all kinds of goodies – adrenaline and raging hormones, but includes very little kiss or sex, perfect for Twilight fans. But I am NOT a Twilight fan. What intrigued me though, were the creative prose, and the compelling plotline.<br/><br/><b><u>THE THING ABOUT MARA DYER</b></u>   is that she survived a fatal accident that killed both of her best friends AND her boyfriend. The only ones she ever had. Unsurprisingly, Mara is diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, remembering nothing about the incident that traumatized her, all the while seeing weird hallucinations of her dead friends. <br/><br/>Moving to Florida and joining the Croyden Academy was supposed to heal her mind. But there she meets Noah Shaw, and unknowingly make enemies with some students and a teacher. Pieces of the events that led to her friends’ death start occupying her nightmares. Seeing things in mind and seeing them actually<i> happen</i> IS unnerving. Mara has a hard time coping with the revelations of her hallucinations and what it makes her.<br/><br/><br/><B>This book, while unique on its own, seems to have borrowed bits and pieces from some other books. </B>For instance, the lead couple’s relationship reminded me of Twilight. The plotline itself felt vaguely similar to [b:Belzhar|20821376|Belzhar|Meg Wolitzer|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1395326170s/20821376.jpg|40167214] and [b:Lucid Dream 1|10257738|Lucid Dream 1|Swati Singla|https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png|15158023]. What absolutely gripped me was the writing though. At a single glance, it seems simple, but the words are woven to make our read more intense and thrilling. The book is fast-paced; you couldn’t put it down even if you wanted to. Just the suspense makes you want to flip over to the last page and see the ending for yourself.<br/><br/><u><b>Pros</b></u><br/><br/>✴ <b>Mara Dyer</b><br/>That’s our protagonist btw. The book is narrated in first person, through Mara’s eyes. The thing is, you don’t really feel like Mara’s telling the story, YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE EXPERIENCING THE STORY BY YOURSELF. It was like virtual-reality came true and became real for once. The way Michelle made it happen is a mystery to me, but she somehow does make it work. Being in the character’s head is kinda thrilling and scary too, yeah.<br/><br/>✴ <b>Noah Shaw</b><br/>Noah is your typical-paranormal-YA boyfriend. I have only so much book-boyfriends but Noah made that list. It’s crazy, I know, because this guy is a sure douchebag. The bad-boy-turns-good-for-love boy. But you know what? Rhett Butler was a douchebag too. But I loved him. I have a long-list of why Noah isn’t the perfect gentleman, it goes like this – <br/><blockquote><br/>**<b><i>He is BEAUTIFUL </b></i>– You may already know why that is bad. Remember Edward Cullen?< <i>*wink*</i><br/>**<b><i>He is a too rich</b></i> – Rich boys in YA are bad, you get me? <br/>**<b><i>He is a womanizer</b></i> – Oh, but so was Rhett <i>*wink x 3*</i><br/>**<b><i>Because Mara is his</b></i> – He owns her; he declares so many times. <br/>**<b><i>He is a control freak</b></i> – He not just says, he acts his part. He acts like he owns Mara.<br/>**<b><i>He is never sorry</b></i> – He used a girl to get back at her brother. He doesn’t bat an eye when she commits suicide. Yeah, yeah I know!<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>What do I do after learning all of this? Fall for him anyway. (Don’t judge me, I haven’t had a boyfriend ever in my life. Period)<br/><br/><u><b>Cons</b></u><br/><br/>✴ <b>Jamie whats-his-last-name</b> ?<br/><br/>I don’t get the point of this character. Why was he even there? To act the part of a tragic hero? As if we haven’t had enough of it already. And all he ever did was accuse Noah of being a womanizer. And teach. Well, he was such a good teacher that Mara mastered Spanish in two weeks with his tutoring. And well, what happens? I’m not going to spoil much for you, but it’s irrelevant. He drops dead for the rest of the story.<br/><br/>✴ <b>The Ending</b><br/><br/>After everything Michelle had put us through, that one was the worst. A big cliffhanger. If I hadn’t already had a copy of the sequel I might have choked on my own tongue then and there iykwim *ahem ahem*<br/><br/><br/><b>Overall, </b>this book wasn’t what I expected from the title and the cover, there wasn’t as much substance. But the intense pace and writing makes up for it. Give it a try, if you love realistic YA paranormal with swoon-worthy romance interests.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The story took on an exciting turn and the ending makes me want to pick up the sequel right now.<br/><br/><b><u>PLOT</u></b><br/><br/>We are once again back into the faery realm with Rylie, an Aurorian faery, or speaking in clichés – The Chosen One. Rylie learns more about her world, what it means to be an Aurorian fae, how important she is to their world, and more about the creatures that reside only here.

About seventy-five percent of the total world-building and <b>character development </b>in the whole series takes place in this book which is what made it exciting. The romance was not much drawn-out and was perfectly handled. My only misgivings are the kisses. The lead couple kisses so damn many times! It’s embarrassing, gross even. I’m sure Rylie’s lips might look like this for real –<br/><img src=""http://cdn1.alloy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Kris-Jenner-lip.gif""><br/><br/>The climax was a bit abrupt though. After all it took to get there, it was disappointing. I got the vibe that the authors aren’t much into writing good action scenes or violence in general. It kind of felt childish to me. In fact the whole story, when you think clearly about it, is pointless and childish, full of loopholes. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. The scenic descriptions were amazing and so were the beautiful fae world. Just the freaking turn the whole story took was impressive, since I never really expected much. <br/><br/><b>In short,</b> if you’ve come as far as the second book in this series, please do pick this up soon.

Run through it already (you wouldnt need help) and tell me what you think about it. Because honestly, every 5-star I see makes me think how and where I read this book wrong. Not that it was bad. If anything, you would emerge out wondering about a whole new dimension of life. <b>BUT. </b>There are some issues this book couldn't get right. Hopefully I can shed some light on them with this review.  <br/><br/><b><u>THE PLOT</U> (spoiler free)</b><br/><br/>  Starr lives with her family in Garden Heights, a neighborhood of Black people. But she and her brothers go to Williamson, a school predominantly attended by White people. Blending in meant putting on a mask of Williamson-Starr whenever she was at school.<br/><br/>  One night, a commotion at a party results in Starr hurrying off with Khalil, a childhood friend of hers, whom she was no longer in touch with. That night, Khalil gets shot by a White Policeman. Reports of Khalil being a gang-member and drug-dealer dominate the news rather than the fact that he was mercilessly killed for no reason. Realizing that she is the only person who can raise her voice, Starr struggles to take out her weapon and use it against the cop, in the fight for justice for Khalil.<br/><br/>  I wasn't familiar with the plotline in anyway but the story unfolded in a rather predictive manner. The starting was difficult to get into, but slowly, once we get a grip of the culture, the diversity is refreshing. Still, there were some issues of racism that bothered me throughout the book –<br/><br/>● <b><u>Black Jesus vs. “Jesus”</u></b><br/><blockquote><br/>  I know I have read of Black Jesus a few times before, but only in the context of this book did the significance hit me bad.<b> Jesus is supposed to be the son of God, and for God's sake, they couldn't avoid categorizing him as Black?</b> Seriously? What difference does it make if Jesus was Black or White or Yellow? Would they abandon their faith if Jesus was white for real? What does that show of themselves and their belief? That they believe in God because he belongs to their race? How faithful!  <br/><br/> What pissed me off even more is the fact that others never really did consider Jesus as ‘white’. One would argue that, it's because White is the default. But what I can't understand is why they have to color their faith in black and whites just because it's in their skin?<b> Just like beauty lies in the heart, belief comes from heart too.</b> No matter the skin color of Jesus, Christians are supposed to believe in him. They're not free to put him out as Black just for the heck of ‘equality’ or whatever.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>● <b><u>Damn, The. H . Y . P . O . C . R. I . S . Y.</b></u><br/><blockquote><br/>  This book is so much about racism, but I still don't get Angie Thomas's idea of it. The Black people think they're ridiculed for their skin color, but they give no thoughts on calling out the white people and ridiculing them for <i>their</i> skin color. And when, Chris, a white boy comes out in support of them and joins the riots, they actually ask him if he is black! What, because he's got a good heart and wanted to stand up for justice?<br/><br/> I could see several such instances where Black people easily accused people of racism, but went on saying shit about the White people because they're <i>WHITE</i>.AND THAT ISN'T BEING A RACIST?!<b> If people want others to treat themselves in a particular way, they should know better than to treat the same others in a way that is any different.</b> While rich White kids are spoilt brats, rich Black kids WORKED HARD TO GET THERE. Cool? NOT COOL.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>● <b><u>The Relationships</b></u><br/><blockquote><br/> To say the good things, the portrayal of a family life was highly relatable, heartwarming and realistic. I love Starr’s family - the realistic sibling relationships, the jealousy, the love, the unity, the little fights and reunions were all showcased VERY WELL.<br/><br/> What I didn't like though, was Starr's relationships outside of family. Especially, the ones at school. I saw no reason one would want to be friends with her. She didn't seem to give a damn about her friends or White boyfriend Chris while they, in fact, treated her better than she deserved. In short, Starr was a bad friend, unlikeable in general. Chris somehow managed to shine in the spotlight, though, and so did Seven, Starr's brother. When I think about it, everyone else in her family was likeable except for Starr. That simple point lessened my sympathy and feelings for this book.<br/> </blockquote><br/><br/>● <b><u>The Themes</b></u><br/><blockquote><br/>  No matter how disappointed I am, I do think that this book is an important piece of literature. Black community is so under-represented in YA literature. I loved that Angie Thomas decided to bring it out with this book. Justice for Black people or minority communities anywhere in the world is a big issue. You don’t get to see YA books that deals with this sort of subjects on a major league. And displaying it so realistically, <spoiler>not going with the usual happily-ever-after</spoiler> was a bold and much-needed move from the author. <br/><br/> For me, <b>that ending said much much more than the whole book ever did.</b><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><br/><b>I would say, despite my 3-star rating, that this book is something everyone must read. <b>THE MESSAGE IT CONVEYS IS TOO POWERFUL TO BE MISSED (Even if it does nothing much to improve our view of Black people).",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Hopefully, I haven't forgotten the art of reviewing! <br/><br/><br/><b>*deep breath*</b><br/><br/><br/><u><b>PLOT</b></u><br/><br/><b>TRIGGER WARNING : Rape, Sexual Abuse<br/><br/>The Final Year Project </b>follows Om, a nerdy Tech student at Amra, throughout his final year, along with his spoilt, ready-for-trouble friends.<br/><br/>Om is a photographer of their college boxing club. His friends, the flirty tech-savy Sid, omniscient Dev and childhood buddy and best friend Vik have a knack of paving the way for trouble while dragging him along. When Om declares his crush on Sarah Morgan, a fresher and the topper of the batch, his friends are determined to set them up by the end of the year.<br/><br/>But when Sarah becomes the manager of their boxing club and turns out to be a tough nut, giving them all a tough time, his friends are not impressed. Om, however sees through her facade while she confides in him the truth about her family, her sister's abuse, her dad's ignorance and her unhappy childhood, he cannot help falling for her. <br/><br/><b>X ------- X ------- X ------- X </b><br/><br/>Reading the title and the synopsis, I was promised of an indulgent campus-novel, but this book turned out to be much more than that. Although, while I was skeptical of starting this book, what with it being my first ARC, Mehana managed to hook me with her slightly thrilling and easy to read flow of writing. <br/><br/><br/><u><b>THOUGHTS</u></b><br/><blockquote><br/>◇•  The story started on a strong note of <b>feminism</b>. The author is undoubtedly a feminist as potrayed through her character of Sarah Morgan. She goes to great lengths to potray gender equality and feminism, to the point that it became quite disturbing and unrealistic. <br/><br/>      For example, there is a boxing game between girls and boys where the girls unanimously win BECAUSE THE BOYS COULDN'T HIT THE GIRLS ANYWHERE. Not in the guts because <i>""hitting a girl in the guts? unmanly!""</i>, not the face because <i>""Why ruin a pretty face?</i>, or chest because its-oh-so-obvious-why.<b> That is not a good way to showcase feministic strength. </b>It infact, highlights weaknesses, that the girls win out of sympathy, which should not be the case. Girls should not have been fighting boys in the first place, because, let's face in, on an average, BOYS ARE PHYSICALLY  STRONGER THAN GIRLS. <br/><br/>Also, the  things both the sides do inorder to avenge the other gender is plainly cruel. The prevalent theme of feminism isn't as prevalent in the second half of the book.<br/><br/>◇▪   The beginning of the book was<b> incredibly slow </b>and hard to get into. There were too many descriptions which was difficult to keep track of, but it WAS INTERESTING all the same. The story itself captured my curiousity. It took me forever to complete the first half, but ONLY A NIGHT to finish the second half. Yeah, engaging it seems.<br/><br/>◇▪   I was completely amazed by how Mehana managed to pull off a <b>male pov </b>so smoothly and realistically. You can't even tell it is by a female author. Seriously, most of the male characters written by female authors are usually unconvincing. But this one was not.<br/><br/>◇▪   There was a part of the book where the author gives us a brief introduction to some concepts of mathematics, which was, obviously very boring and which I PROMPTLY SKIPPED. Seriously, I really felt it was completely unnecessary. An whole page on sequences and series! My! My! I have had enough of them in my higher secondary classes, thank you very much!<br/><br/>◇▪   The <b>characters</b> and their development were forecasted brillianlty. They are morally gray characters who show a hint of redemption and righteousness. The message given through them touches deep and true. <br/><br/>◇▪   The <b>suspense</b> was very entertaining. It was mysterious, engrossing and surprising in the end. The author also tries to deal with many themes and subjects without being too obvious about it. The way the issues of rape and abuse were handled, the accute potrayal of the situation of girls in India are noteworthy.<br/><br/>◇▪   Overall, the nostalgic representation of a student's college life and the world Mehana built in the campus of Amra, was really good to read. A small fault was that the location was not very descriptive. I had no idea where the story actually took place or how it looked like, excpet that there are vague references to Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. Other than that, we see no real demonstration of the varied culture of the Tamilians.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><b>I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good campus story, with romance, fun, mischief and mystery. A really good book that deals with many issues that needed to be dealt with. Good debut.</b><br/><br/><i>I received an e-ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.

In short, this would be a really bad standalone even if there isn’t much story it is carrying forward from the prequel.<br/><br/>There were a lot of revelations in this book. The authors tried to add more and more details to this faery world they had created, but to me it felt dumb, as if not much consideration was given to the world-building or characterization as much as the romance. <br/><br/>Another thing that bugged me was the protagonist. Not that she was unlikable; in fact her narrative was very soothing and comfortable. But the way she treated people around her was very unfair. Her cousins especially, threatening them to get her way, and Adam too. The way she ended things with him without as much as an explanation, was cruel of her. Not that I like Adam. Ugh no, Rylie and Adam’s relationship was basically just kissing-mates, nothing else. Still, no one deserves to be treated the way Rylie treated Adam.<br/><br/>The characters themselves were a bit unrealistic and two-dimensional. They did not show any reactions a normal human (or faery) would have under their circumstances AND their straightforward behavior was too good to be believable. The happily-ever-after ending didn’t do much to warm me up either.<br/><br/>In short, this book had no impact on me whatsoever. No sort of emotional response from my side. Since I wasn’t actually expecting anything, I am not that disappointed either. Like I said, neutral. Recommended to fans of Twilight, or ‘normal’ paranormal beings. Others- you have better books to read. <br/><br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The only considerable quality of this book is the WRITING STYLE. Your overall opinion on this book might solely depend on that factor – you either love it or hate it.<br/><br/>✴<b><u>THE PLOT</u></b><br/><br/> Juliet has been enclosed in prison for 264 days. Abandoned by family, secluded by the society for her lethal touch, Juliet has nothing in her life to keep her going other than hope. Hope that one of these days she’ll become less of a monster, hope that her parents would love her, hope that she would see the white bird with a crown flying high in the sky – hope that she can somehow fly with the white bird.<br/><br/>But Warner, the leader of their sector, is suddenly interested in her and her powers. She gets released only to the condition that she’d help Warner. Being branded as a monster and becoming one are completely different scenarios and Juliet has to face that option. In the midst of this dystopia it is only Adam and her hope that keeps Juliet from losing her mind. Discovering that there are other people like her was the first step. Now she realizes that her touch has the power to save the world too, instead of destroying it.<br/><br/>•	There really wasn’t much focus on the plot. The world-building was delusional at best. <br/><br/>•	The dystopian world Tahereh Mafi has created lacks all the quality of a proper dystopian world. There was nothing really motivating the story, nothing to look forward to, which made the read all the more forced.<br/><br/>•	The concept had so much potential but the execution has me irked. <b>What a terrible waste of a brilliant idea due to sheer focus on romance!</b> There were all sorts of possibilities to be explored, but Mafi either considered us fools to fall for the romance, or was a fool herself to focus on that, rather than create some original substance for her book.<br/><br/>✴<b><u>The Writing</u></b><br/><br/>So much has been said about the writing style in this book, all sorts of good and bad things, both of which are entirely justifiable. For me, the <b>writing style was unlike anything I’ve read before</b>. That was the sole reason I was motivated to read this book. And yeah, it was brilliant.<b> Creative, original, imaginative, just the kind where words weaved up to make you either cringe or marvel in delight.</b><br/><br/> Though, sometimes the writings were overdone. The descriptions were overly descriptive and sometimes just plain absurd. <br/><br/>•	Seems like Mafi hasn’t heard of the world <b>blush</b>. She uses so many other metaphors to describe the single word.<br/><br/><b><i><blockquote> ‘’red paints my face, bleeds through my skin’’</blockquote></i></b><br/><br/><br/><b><i><blockquote> I’m dripping red paint on the carpet. </blockquote></i></b><br/><br/><br/><b><i><blockquote>I catch the rose petals as they fall from my cheeks, as they float around the frame of my body, as they cover me in something that feels like the absence of courage. </blockquote></i></b><br/><br/><br/>•	Umm, that’s too much, even for me? <br/>•	But there were some awesome descriptions too, and I loved some of them because they were the renditions of what I used to feel myself.<br/><br/> ✴<b><u>The Characters</u></b><br/><br/>Unlike in many other YA dystopias, the main character here is not a fake-badass-super heroine. In fact Juliet is portrayed to be a pitiful, self-pitying, powerless young girl. For most parts, she was likeable.<br/><br/>Enter Adam. The moment she lays her eyes on him, describing his deep-blue eyes, bulging muscles and her urge to touch him is the only thing Juliet can talk about. There was no development whatsoever in their relationship.<br/>And then there is Warner. His character is intriguing in a way, but yet, there again comes a romance element. Come on, can’t a man and woman lay eyes on each other without having romantic thoughts? No wonder the whole world has come to be the way it is. <br/><br/><br/>My favorite character however, is James. The 10-year old brother of Adam is the best thing in the whole book. Loved the way he was introduced, his sarcasm, wit, and innocence. He is too good for this world xD<br/><br/><br/>When talking about characters, I must say, there didn’t seem to be any kind of development. Maybe because this is just the first book in the series, or maybe because development happens overtime; but the characters were flat, one dimensional. Which is why I can’t even say two more words about them ha-ha.<br/><br/>✴<b><u>Overall</u></b><br/><br/>  Well, with the exception of the writing style, this book provided nothing new. The plot is just the same old overly used dystopian trope – heroine saves the world from the deadly dangerous ruler and lives with the love of her life happily forever after. The love triangle can be sense miles ahead, and really, that is NOT something I want to get entangled in any sooner.<br/><br/>The ending, even if not conclusive, didn’t for a moment make me want to dive in to the next book and I am not sure I would do that in the near future.<br/><br/><b>Recommended for – fans of dystopia with a metaphorical writing style.<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

There might have been a lot of grammar errors if not for the fact that it was poetry. (call me a grammar nerd, but yeah!) The poet writes in un-capitalized letters which somehow makes the read more effective, the message clearer. It was erotic at times, but striking all the same.

The writing was good, the humor actually made me laugh, and most of the time I had on this big smile plastered onto my face that it actually hurt.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised that I loved the beginning of the book. Dimple seemed like an amazing MC. But I hated that her character seemed to lack the initial charisma later on in the novel.  Rishi, on the other hand, maintained his Mr. Goody-two-shoes position throughout. And the main reason this book appealed to me was that the two of them loved what I loved the most – computers and art. But while the whole point of the Insomnia Con thing was coding, that topic faded off completely as the story progressed. And this whole meeting-love-romance happens in a span of six weeks, (of which we got to see only the first three weeks), which was ridiculous. The ending, was like any typical Bollywood romance <spoiler>sealed with a kiss. </spoiler><br/><br/>Would I recommend this book? – Yup, for all those who don’t mind a clichéd romance with a desi (Indian) twist.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

And magic. And everything in between. This book is magical, emotional, action-packed and in one word – brilliant. V.E Schwab, you are imaginative and daring – you’re one of a kind OR the kind is one of you. Simply, you’re my new favorite author.<br/><br/><b>LET’S SEE WHAT THIS BOOK WAS ABOUT…</b><br/><br/>After Holland was gone, and White London fell, Kell thought he would breathe easier. But he was wrong. King Maxim and Queen Emira of Red London are determined to keep Kell grounded, as long as it means their son, Prince Rhy would remain safe. With Lila gone and a new responsibility of holding Rhy’s life in his hands, Kell is as impatient as ever.<br/><br/>Also, Red London is hosting The Elemental Games this year, where magicians come forward to show their prowess and win the crown. Delilah Bard, reckless as always, decides to try her hand at the tournament. But little did she know that she wasn’t going to be the only disguise…<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in White London, a new king has emerged and the kingdom is flourishing. But the king is not so forgiving to the one Antari who led the downfall of his kingdom, <i>Kell</i>. Or, is he?<br/><br/><b>An aspiring and reckless pirate, a magician held prisoner in his own home, a charming Prince with a life debt, a king reborn to a flourishing kingdom while bound to destroy another…. What will it all lead to?</b><br/><br/><u>Few of the very best things about this book..,</u><br/><br/><b>1. DELILAH BARD</b><br/>This woman is my most favorite person in literature right now. I’m pretty sure the book wouldn’t have been half as good if not for Lila. (Just kidding! But yeah?). Unlike most of the lead heroines in YA fantasies, the character of Lila hasn’t gone on a reclining spiral. Instead it has gone all the way up and established itself as one of the best badass female character ever written. Lila is reckless, ruthless, brave to the point of madness, quick, sharp-witted and as clever as she is all those things. <br/><br/><b><i><blockquote>""I am one of a damned kind.""</b><br/><br/><i><blockquote>""Everyone thinks I have a death wish, you know? But I don’t want to die- dying is easy. No, I want to live, but getting closer to death is the only way to feel alive. And once you do, it makes you realize that everything you were doing before wasn’t actually living. It was just making do. Call me crazy, but I think we do the best living when the stakes are high.""</i></blockquote><br/><br/><b><i><blockquote>Perhaps power had to be tended, like Tieren said, but not all things grew in gardens. Plenty of plants grew wild. And Lila had always thought of herself more as weed than a rose bush.</b></i></blockquote><br/><br/><i><blockquote>Probably not, but if anyone could make the strange seem ordinary, the impossible look easy, it was Delilah Bard.<br/></i></blockquote><br/><br/>In this book, we also get to see the other side of the façade – the slightly human side – of Delilah Bard. I’m gay when it comes to Lila. And generous. So here’s more –<br/><br/><b><i><blockquote><br/>""People could only hurt you if you cared enough to let them.""</b><br/><br/><i><blockquote>""Walking away had been easy. Not looking back was harder.""</i></blockquote><br/><br/><i><blockquote><b>""I’m sorry"" Alucard said.<br/>""For growing on me?"" She asked.<br/>He shook his head. ""For whatever happened to you. For whoever hurt you so deeply that you see things like friends and fondness as weapons instead of shields.""</b></i></blockquote><br/><br/><i><blockquote>People survived by being cautious, but they got ahead by being bold.</i></blockquote><br/><br/>I’m pretty sure that is as far as I can go before being arrested for violating copyrights. Anyway, you get the point? LILA BARD IS AMAZING AS HELL, AND ONE HUNDRED PERCENT MY FAVORITE CHARACTER FOREVER. (It’s funny, to fangirl so hard about a fictional character, while knowing full well that you wouldn’t like them if they existed in real life and you happened to meet. Guess that’s the difference between fiction and reality lol!)<br/>So moving on..,<br/><br/><b>2. KELL</b><br/>I am astonished at the amount of character building that has taken place in this book. Honestly, I wasn’t so fond of Kell in ADSoM, but this book has breathed an amazing persona into him. He’s become more charismatic, brave, upfront and more <i>himself</i>. More <i>real</i>. <br/><br/>Every moment when he fought for himself, every moment he missed Lila, every moment that displayed his loyalty to the Royals, every moment he thought of Rhy – they were just so complete and honest and right. This completeness, precision of thoughts and emotions, were missing from the first book, and I’m so glad to see it developed here. I cried every moment he cried, and laughed along with his joy. We’re soulmates! <br/><br/>Also, the fights – the duels. HE IS A FREAKING AMAZING, AND SKILLED. I LOVE HIS AUBURN HAIR, HIS GRACE, TALENT AND WELL, HIS COAT. AAaarghh!! The end though! <spoiler>Please someone save him. Lila!!! I’m looking at you. Hurry up. Where’s the next book??? I’m coming Kell,, you just hang on and please don’t let the seal break!! </spoiler><br/><br/><b>3. RHY</b><br/>The prince has matured so much and he has become so very adorable yet! The characterization is again, mindblowing. I loved that we got to see more of his perspectives. He makes up for his lack of magic with his charm, smile and his love for everything. I did suspect he would be gay, but that was a surprise! <spoiler> Alucard Emery?</spoiler><br/><br/>Also, I was taken back by the way he cared for his brother. Till now, we only got to see Kell being worried for Rhy, and I wasn’t sure how much Rhy would do for Kell. My doubts be damned! Rhy is as loyal to Kell as I am. <spoiler> That SORRY broke my heart!</spoiler><br/><br/><b>4. HOLLAND</b><br/>Well, he barely made an appearance. But when he did, he summoned all my hatred and left it burning. Yeah sure, there is more to him than meets the eye, but please, CAN WE JUST GET TO SEE HOLLAND AS HIMSELF FOR ONCE??? Hoping to see that in the next book. And people, he deserves a chance!!<br/><br/><b>Overall,</b> this book is imaginative and thoughtful in its plot, perfect in its characterization and brilliant in its execution. Could not have been any better. <br/><b>5/5 stars and more",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Intimidating?</b> But then as always, Jessica made sure her readers are satisfied with the ending.<br/><br/><br/><b>**TRIGGER WARNING** - Rape, Violent thoughts, Murder, Excessive swearing</b><br/><br/><br/>Let me attempt a review here. I am going to make it slightly more critical because I think Jessica has really improved as an author. So here it goes –<br/><br/><b><u>THE PLOT</u></b><br/><br/>That night at her school in Mr. Edmund’s classroom changed everything for Alice. Her father was back to Small Town and she wasn’t very happy about it. After all, he left Alice and her Mum all those years ago for another woman. <br/>Mr. Edmund is still on loose, and there is no telling when and whom he’ll attack next. She must be the one to put an end to his killing sprees. <br/><br/>Things aren’t going very well with Alice and Ryder either, but to take down Mr. Edmund, Alice needs allies. Who’d want to help her avenge her mother’s death? Would Alice forgive her father after everything that has happened? <br/> <br/><b><u>My Thoughts</u></b><br/><br/>•      The writing was simple yet raw. Could have used some editing.<br/><br/>•	The book started right off where the last one ended. It was a bit difficult to understand what was going on. But yeah, we got a<b> recap </b>later when Alice recounts it to her best friend Sam. Still, I was a bit baffled in the beginning.<br/><br/><br/>•	<b>Alice.</b> I don’t think Alice is a likeable protagonist. At. All. Her actions and behavior were too much sometimes. She had no right to blame her father for a murder he had no role in. And btw <b>she goes on blaming every other person for her mother’s murder, it’s insane!</b> <spoiler>She hates Mr. Edmund for being the mastermind, and Silver for doing it. She then blames her Dad because he wasn’t there to protect her Mom because he left years ago? And then she blames Nora too, claiming she was the one to lure her Dad away in the first place. <s>WTF?!</s></spoiler> <br/><br/>Let me get this clear<b>; Blaming someone for a murder they had no hand in, is absolutely horrible. </b>The guilt build-up is inevitable even if you had no role in it whatsoever. Especially if it’s the murder of someone close to you.<b> No one deserves to live with such guilt for the rest of their lives.</b> <br/><br/>Besides, Alice is also a hypocrite. She goes on and on about why no one should kill anyone for a murder beyond their control, all the while intending to kill someone herself. Her violent nature kind-of appalled me. At the same time, I was also glad she embraced the changes in her.<br/><br/><br/>•	<u>THE CHARACTERS</u>. I am surprised at the character growth that takes place in this novel. Sam, Ryder, and Max. Also Mark, and yeah Nora. Oh, and <b>especially Bane</b>. Besides Alice, I think I loved everyone else.  Kellan’s character was a bit low for some reason. Jessica has done a great job with her characters, they’re memorable, each one of them unique.<br/><br/><br/>•	To me, the use of profanity was a bit too much. I don’t think kids swear like that. I mean, <b>how can you even pronounce a sentence with so many f*cks in place?</b> It was unrealistic, overdone and completely unnecessary.<br/><br/><br/>•	<b>Use of rape as a plot device.</b> Again, I didn’t see why this had to be the case. It was easily avoidable. The casual manner in which it was handled might be triggering for some people.<br/><br/><br/>•	There were some instances where characters were <b>stereotyped for the way of dressing.</b> I never thought I’d be siding up for short dresses and I’m the last person you’d see in a mini-skirt, but I think calling someone an<b><i> “expensive dirty prostitute”</i></b> for their dressing choices is unacceptable. Again, that is one more reason Alice didn’t work for me.<br/><br/><br/>•	<b>The ending</b>. I wasn’t actually looking forward to the ending because I thought there might be too much blood shedding. Thank God I was wrong. That ending was a pleasant surprise. <b>The Epilogue though!</b> From Max’s pov! I couldn’t have asked for more. <br/><br/><br/><b>Overall</b> this book didn’t amaze me like the other two books did, but it wasn’t disappointing either. Jessica Edwards has so much potential, I can’t wait to discover her future works! <b>3.5/5 stars</b><br/><br/><b>P.S Thanks to the author for sending me a copy of this book!

Witty, reckless, action-packed,</B> everything I’d hoped for. But I still can’t ignore the fact that what it delivered certainly wasn’t what I wanted. Yeah this definitely might be its-me-not-the-book thing. Seriously though? I have to admit I was totally engrossed, finishing this humongous book in two days. And now that I’ve gotten through the initial inability to write a coherent review, I can sum up some of it (it also means I have practically forgotten everything I’ve wanted to say, but let’s just ignore that, okay? Okay.)<br/><br/><i>**there might be mild spoilers ahead, but does it really matter at this point?**</i><br/><br/><br/><b><u>THE PLOT</U></B><br/><br/>So Mead certainly did quite a good job of adding much more mystery, suspense and substance into this book(which is to be expected, since it’s the last one). <br/><br/>I’ll not say much about the plot since it would be too spoiler-y. But here are the basics: <br/><br/><b>Queen is dead--Rose imprisoned--Dimitri is too--Queen Tatiana’s letter--Another surviving Dragomir--On the run--Sydney plays a big role--Lissa nominated for Monarchy--Another Strigoi turns normal --Chaos at court</b><br/><br/>For once, I was actually intrigued by the plotline, believe me, it’s hard not to. The story takes off right away with lots of action and explosion. It was just a bang. I knew my heart was thumping aloud the whole time. But then, the book was over, the suspense wore off, I came to my senses and realized, it was all just a trance.<br/><br/> The plot, while it focused less on romance, (it was still there – ever so cheesy, but I have long since learned to overlook that fact.) the Author has tried to include so much in this book, and it kind of worked. It takes off our attention from the bigger PLOTHOLES which were always there. <br/><br/>Lord, I guess I’m still not capable of this review; my thoughts are so messed up, I should have learned to jot them down as soon as they formed. But heck, I’m not going to let this book get in the way of my clouded thinking.<br/><br/><b><u>RANDOM THOUGHTS</U></B><br/><br/>•	Richelle Mead might be a feminist, or might not be one. From reading her books, I certainly did see some feminism and sometimes felt her writing was <b>extremely anti-feministic. </b><br/><br/>•	For example, take Rose. She is built up to be the strongest, most badass character ever,. And yet she and others are subjected to so much <b>BODYSHAMING</b> it sucks. It’s as if having a little more of curves and breasts make her more feminine. But describing other woman to be less attractive because they are tall and flat-chested doesn’t make her one. See this line from Spirit Bound for proof -<br/><br/><blockquote><b><i>It certainly wasn’t meant to be sexy, but the way it hugged my stomach and hips did good things for my body</i></b></blockquote><br/><br/>•	There is also <b>discrimination</b> going on here. While there might be a Royal clan and non-royals, actively describing non-royals as ‘ordinary’ is not that smart. As if Royals are in anyway extraordinary than them. As if non-royals are worthless beings just because their lineage didn’t include kings. In fact, most of the royals in this book are just stupid spoilt fools imo.<br/><br/>•	Speaking of feminism, why are mostly all the rulers Queens? I mean, yeah equality is fine and all, but hey, you don’t have to go overboard with that alright? <br/><br/>•	And too, the discrimination between Moroi and Dhampirs is downright cruel. Why are Dhampirs treated lower than Moroi, I won’t understand. Why can’t they be kings, queens, royals? They’re an extincting specie for god’s sake! <br/>And Rose can sleep with Strigoi but is extremely offended at the idea of Moroi sleeping with humans? <b>How thoughtful, Rose. </b><br/><br/>•	Another issue, Abe Mazur. He is Rose’s father and he knew she was his daughter all this while, but only thought of turning up when she became 18? <b>What, do people need to be of age to know who their parents are? </b>And what makes it even more unrealistic is the fact that Abe becomes an over-protective, loving and a proud father all of a sudden. Seems to me Rose should have known about her father a while ago atleast.<br/><br/>Richelle Mead has also so much more to improve in the way of giving<b> depth </b>to her story. In fact, I don’t think she improved at all throughout the six books. But I must appreciate; the dry <b>humor </b>cracked me up at the most unexpected places. Like,<i> really</i> cracked me up. But the certain issues with depth were really hard to ignore.<br/><br/><b><u>The Relationships</u></b><br/><br/>•	<b>Rose & Dimitri</b><br/>I CAN’T BE THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO HATES THIS DUO TOGETHER, RIGHT? There has to be someone else, someone who can really see the relationship for what it truly is - <i><b>lust</b></i><br/><br/>Rose is highly incapable of describing true love. All the philosophical insights she gave on love went right above my head. And most of the time, she is always thinking of sex. I was unfazed throughout their whole relationship. <br/><br/>Rose repeatedly says she and Dimitri understood each other perfectly, that they were meant to be. <b><i>How touching!</b></i> But in reality, there was no instance <b>when we actually get to see that for ourselves.</b> We never feel, ‘’Yes they are perfect!’’ ‘’They love each other so much!’’ even when all the while Mead continues to try convincing us. And, making Dimitri to be the God he isn’t, was downright pathetic. Rose isn’t even a believer. I really don’t get why these two are supposedly “made for each other”<br/><br/><br/>•	<b>Rose & Lissa</b><br/>This had no depth either. Without the bond I don’t even think these two would have been friends. Rose had a different personality and Lissa had a unique one too. All the time Rose <b>says</b> they’re best friends but <b>never do we actually get to see them together.</b><br/>It’s always either through the bond. When they are in the same place, we barely even see them hang out. But even if we don’t get to see their development, they share an intense relationship too. Proved by how much they care for each other. <b>This too, is to be deduced by the reader, because, WE ALL KNOW BY NOW THAT MEAD IS AN UNCONVINCING WRITER</b>.<br/><br/><br/>•	<b>Rose & Adrian</b> <br/>Why these two even got together is beyond my comprehension. Adrian was fiercely loyal to Rose (who wasn’t? -.- ). Considering his personality, we might think it might be up to Adrian to cheat, but Rose got ahead again. She deludes herself into thinking she loves Adrian all the while pining for Dimitri and calling it ‘moving on’. She had no right to do all that she did to Adrian.  And cheating on him with her ex-boyfriend, saying she is <i>independent</i> and <i>can make decisions for herself</i>. God, I can only bear so much.<br/><br/><br/>•	<b>Christian and Lissa</b><br/>Because, this was a relationship Mead didn’t actively pursue and bring into attention, I really liked it. When Mead brings her characters to the spotlight, she has a tendency to spoil it. Thankfully, that didn’t happen in this case. These two were perfect for each other, a lot more so than Rose and Dimitri, mostly because Mead didn’t try to convince us that they were perfect for each other.<br/><br/><br/>Now that relationships are unpacked, I want to focus on the biggest thing I hated about this book – <br/><b>ROSE AND HER HAPPILY-EVER-AFTER</b><br/>I don’t know how to put my thoughts into words; I’ll try my best though. I just want to get it out of my system and say it all aloud. <br/><br/><b> Richelle Mead idealizes, idolizes Rose in every cringe-worthy way possible.</b>  <br/><br/>•	She wins every fight. Four Strigoi? Rose and Dimitri are enough. Ten? Doesn’t matter. Like, when she catches a Strigoi by surprise, she wins. But when the Strigoi catches her by surprise, her years of training <i>kicks in</i>. She wins. Simple.<br/><br/>•	Everyone is fiercely loyal to her, while according to Rose herself, she is <i>independent</i> and is <i>not condemned to anyone.</i><br/><br/>•	She<b> uses </b>every friend and foe loyal to her and just… leaves.<br/><br/>o	<B>Eddie –</B> supported her all the while, helped her escape prison, and followed her around the world on a death mission. What does Rose do? Forget him as soon as she has what she wants.<br/><br/>o	<B>Adrian –</B> she basically exhausted all of his funds by travelling around the world, gets his help every time she is in trouble, uses his money on the trip to bring back her ex-boyfriend and ditches him when the love of her life is back.<br/><br/>o	<B>Victor –</B> he might be a passionate royal or whatever, but she had no right to use him to fulfill all her bloody plans and then kill him afterward.<br/><br/>o	<B>Robert –</B>that guy saved a strigoi, but since Rose has better job to do, she leaves him insane on the streets, never giving an after-thought.<br/><br/>o	<B>Sydney –</B>she is practically the reason why Rose survived that entire ordeal, but i-have-better-things-to-do Rose doesn’t ever give a damn on what happens to her.<br/><br/>o	<B>Christian –</B>he had always been there for her and Lissa, but what did Rose do? Never even thinks of him even after calling out on his aunt for murdering the Queen. Seriously, Rose MUST have confronted Christian after what she did? Surely? Hmm? Oops, sorry, I forgot we were talking about Rose. <br/><br/>You see,? <B>Rose is the most heartless person ever,</B> she is too selfish and never gives another thought about those who were there for her in times of need. But according to Mead, Rose is right in doing everything she did, because her intentions were all good. Were they? No actually not. Everything she did has a selfish motivation behind them. I can’t believe she didn’t ever feel guilty for doing all that.<br/><br/><br/><b>As for the ending</b>, I saw that coming miles before. I don’t actually understand why Mead made it out to be such a big suspense when the answer was so obvious. I’m even wondering if she intentionally made the murderer obvious. Either way, she didn’t bother explaining how Rose cleared her name, how the evidences that were clearly pointing to her, suddenly start pointing to someone else. Instead, Rose nearly dies and comes back to life <i>because of her resolve to live.</i><br/><br/><b> It is almost funny how simple Richelle Mead has made death to be</b>. You die? Fine. You want to live? Boom! You’re alive again. Such ridiculous logic! (I actually leaped in joy when Rose died, but well, knowing Mead, I had to give up hopes of her<i> actually </i>dying)<br/><br/><br/>On an afterthought, I can’t resist adding that this book was <B>completely unoriginal,</B> I felt like it had a mix of most of those YA series out there – Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Divergent… I haven’t read many others to add more. But yeah, the plotlines can certainly be traced to those books.<br/><br/><br/>There had been so much more to say, but I’ve clearly started wearing off my memories of this book. It was entertaining, yes, but not enough to create a lasting impression on my mind. I’m glad this is over though! Would I read the spin-off series? Idk. I might, since it is not from Rose’s perspective. And I kind of am curious to know if Mead has really grown a brain and bothered to explain things that she promptly skipped over in this book.<br/><br/><br/> <b>2.5/5 stars</b><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I am not so sure. But this one started quite sometime after. <br/>Rose and Adrian are dating. Yeah, finally. But she is not very sure of her feelings for him. She is <b><i>confused</b></i>. Because, duh, her ex-boyfriend is dead (undead-whatever) and might have a shot at being bought to life which would mean busting a notorious criminal out from his high-security prison. So what does <i><b>invincible, reckless, i-am-in-control-of-everything</b></i> Rose do? She emotionally manipulates, Lissa, her best friend, who thinks she owes her, in coming with her to bust that monster out and try to regain a Strigoi, which might not even be possible. In doing so, they are risking the entire Vampire world, Rose and Lissa’s future, the love and life of everyone they hold dear, to accomplish what? <b>To bring a dead man out alive because Rose loved him.</b> (Raise your hands if you didn’t cringe at that?)<br/><br/>Anyways, Miracles do happen and it happens here, but one problem leads to another, and in the end, Rose finds herself tackled in a web of conspiracies and an impossible quest; she isn’t even sure how she got herself there, or even worse, how she’d ever be able to get herself out. <br/><br/><b><u>MY THOUGHTS</U> </b><s>more like, my tangled chain of emotions</s><br/><br/>•	Let’s be real and admit this: <b>Rose is the most annoying, whiny, emotionally manipulative, utterly-selfish, reckless brat who does EVERYTHING with selfish notions <s>and regrets every bit of her recklessness later<s></b>. Like, for most part of this book, I ABSOLUTELY HATED HER. In fact, I can’t even remember an instant when she was bearable. She was awful to those who loved her, using them to get her way in and out of things, and not even giving a second thought on how much her actions might affect them. <br/><br/>•	Btw, the way she described her love-life. <b>Disgusting.</b> It was as if the only good thing about being in love was the kisses, cuddles and sex. <br/><br/>•	<b>I DON’T SHIP ROSE AND DIMITRI.</B> There – I say it again and I will say this all the time. I didn’t see any development in their relationship. I don’t even think they make a good pair. Because, honestly, Dimitri and Rose are the most annoying MCs I’ve read yet. Oh, Heck. They make the best pair. They are perfect for each other.<br/><br/>•	But darn, Rose, why do you hurt my baby Adrian so much??? You know you aren’t going to stick around when Dimitri is back and yet you stay in hopes of comforting him. <b>Are you crazy???</b> You don’t get to control everybody’s mind by just being there!!! <br/><br/>•	Oh, sorry, I totally forgot. She IS crazy.<br/><br/>•	<b>Lissa</b> has to be the best thing to happen in this book. Her character development was remarkable. I loved her better than Rose, but still, it’s not completely enough.<br/> <br/>•	Likewise, I LOVE CHRISTIAN’s character. Amazing. Bold. Ready-for-action. Cool. Just right for Lissa. <br/><br/>•	And not to mention, Adrian. How could he be such a bundle of pitiful-cutie-pie? I hate that he is still bowled over by Rose, but nevertheless. HE IS AMAZING.<br/><br/>•	The thing is, Mead doesn’t give much thought to her side-characters. The whole thing is just about Rose, Rose and Rose. Plus Dimitri (thankfully, not as much as in the last book though)<br/><br/>•	If she had given Adrian, Lissa, Christian and some others, a fair chance, a bit more role, development, this book would have been so much better. Where is Jill btw?<br/><br/>•	Another thing about Rose that I hate – the whole book might be about her – but it is impossible how she gets her way ALL THE DAMN TIME. Come on! She’s barely adult, she is stupid even. There is no explanation as to how those ‘ideas’ come to her. Everything seems way too <i>convenient</i> for her and it’s unrealistic how EVERYTHING <i>happens in her favor.</i><br/><br/>•	Be reasonable Mead, you don’t have to go out of the way to make us like Rose. It can’t be always her. She’s the heroine of the story, true. Doesn’t mean there’s no other person who’s a hero too. Doesn’t have to be Rose all the time.<br/><br/>•	Like, people have turned Strigoi for centuries now and they’ve earned the title as evil-creatures-of-the-night. But when Rose’s so-called-soulmate turns into one, there suddenly appears to be a way to restore them back to human? Ofcourse, MIRACLE. Duh. So simple.<br/><br/>•      And I’m now going to address another important but highly overlooked issue here - <b>MONEY</b> Yeah I know, it might be the least of your concerns, but really, the way money is made out to be the most commonly available thing ever? It’s offending. Rose is rich by no means, but she says she is funded by Adrian who is royal, but come one! Even Royals have their limit! Living in luxurious hotels and flying to some country every other minute? It’s not just costly, IT IS SUPER EXPENSIVE. How can anyone not see that? From the way Mead writes it, Rose might sctuslly be walking over a carpet of money. IT. IS. INSANE. THE AMOUNT OF MONEY – NOT HERS – SHE SPENDS.<br/><br/>•	I’ve said this once, (twice? Idk), the plot is as repetitive as it can get. It is always the same thing over and over again. Someone gets kidnapped. Mostly Lissa. Rose leads a group of guardians to them. They emerge victorious. End of story. Happily Ever After. Cool.<br/><br/><br/><b>Overall,</b> this book was way too long for what good it did to the series. The plot is repetitive, but the ending came as a total surprise even when I was spoiled on the book’s happenings. I love the action part though, not too confusing, just enough to grip you on edge. But it’s still annoying – this technique of Mead to write horribly for most of the book and finally grab us with the endings. No one’s complaining tbh.<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I really did. I didn’t know I was capable of such patience. You see, this book was slow. Like, had-to-drag-my-ass-through-it-while-it-felt-like-cement slow.  I had to restrain myself so many times from just flicking over to the end and finding out what Mead had done with the ending this time. Admittedly, when it came, it wasn’t bad. It felt good actually. But those momentary pleasure of action was short-lived and I don’t think it was worth all the forcing-myself I had to do to get there. <b>2.5/5 stars.</b><br/><br/><b>So this is the plot (or so it claims to be) –</b> Dimitri is dead. No, undead. He has turned strigoi. Rose had promised to free him from that soulless state. So she left the Academy, left Lissa and everyone, in pursuit of Dimitri. She sets off to Siberia, Dimitri’s homeland in hopes of finding him there. But it turns out to be a daunting task. With help from Sydney, an Alchemist, and Abe Zmey, a mysterious all-knower, Lissa soon finds Dimitri. Or rather, finds herself in Dimitri’s clutches. She is forced to make a decision- to turn Strogoi by choice or be turned by force. Impossible. Finding herself addicted to the lure of the man she used to love – now a monster - Rose has to regain her senses and be where she is needed – with Lissa. <br/><br/><b>Well, my first problem with this book was the plot itself.</b> It was totally ridiculous, lacked substance and existed solely on our sympathy for the main character. I don’t really know what purpose this book serves to the whole series, because honestly, there is nothing much it adds to it. We begin and end the book, and the <b>story is still at the same place it had been before we began.</b> That’s bad. A sequel is supposed to continue a story, give it new dimensions, give us reasons, explanations. But no, that doesn’t happen. It feels to me like the whole book was about a love quest. Unnecessary. Vampire Academy could have used one less book. <br/><br/>The story is totally <b>predictable, ludicrous,</b> and while Mead does try to show the mental struggles of a drug addict, I didn’t think it worked in a positive way.<b> The ending?</b> I hated it. Pointless, stupid. I had thought that everything’s over for good. But no, feels like a circle – starts and ends at the same point – going nowhere else.  <br/><br/>Here’s another - <b><u>Character Analysis</b></u> -<br/><br/>•	<b>Rose</b> <br/><br/>I don’t even know why I thought I was similar to Rose. We are polar opposites. She is very different from the Rose she had been in the first book. And I don’t mean that in the sense of character development either. She had been all badass and carefree back then, but now she is just another lovesick teenager. Considering her stance on protecting Lissa a while back, her sudden change of mind is utterly unbelievable. She acts stupid for most parts of the book. Cummon, she fought a battle with Strigois and always had her emotions in check and suddenly drops to be a cry baby who passes out after handling two strigois? THAT HAS TO BE THE WORST CASE OF CHARACTER UNDER-DEVELOPMENT EVER. <br/><br/>And can we talk about that bedroom scene in the third book, which makes up like 85% of this book too? Honestly? I’m completely fed up of hearing Rose talk about Dimitri all the time. Come to think of it, This book was just Dimitri and Rose. They’re like the center of mass that holds the whole universe. But for me? I HATE THEM> <b>AM I THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO DOESN’T SHIP ROSE AND DIMITRI?? BECAUSE, LIKE,THERE WAS NO DEVELOPMENT IN THERE.</b> <br/>According to Rose, Dimitri understands her perfectly but there is no indication of why and hows or in what weird way they became that close. I mean,yeah there’s the sex and all – but that was all there was to their relationship imo. A physical attraction. <br/><br/>I REALLY HOPE ROSE STOPS MENTIONING DIMITRI ALL THE TIME SHE OPENS HER DAMN MOUTH OR ELSE I AM READY TO RULE OFF THE NEXT BOOK<br/><br/>•	<b>Dimitri</b><br/><br/>He has to be the damnedest, blandest character to ever exist in a book and get involved with the protagonist. I can’t even realize why he was bearable in the first two books. <br/>HE IS SUCH A FLAT CHARACTER, LIKE TELL ME SOMETHING OTHER THAN HE IS SEXY AND STRONG AND FIGHTS STRIGOIS. But Mead did try to give him some charm by introducing his family to us –  honestly though? BAKING BREAD FOR HIMSELF? – that is the only thing we get to know. OMG How charming and appealing, he’s my dream boy. Bleh. Good Lord he is dead. Please stop making a fuss over his dead body Rose because he doesn’t even deserve to be back on earth with that blank character scale of his.  Why does everyone love him? I don’t even.. eh never mind.<br/><br/>And the other thing – he’s Strigoi. He wants Rose. You see that? Every damn Strigoi we have encountered in the past three books never hesitated a moment to kill whatever came in front of them. They’re the most brutal beings ever to exist in the history of the Vampire World according to Rose, and suddenly, when Dimitri turns Strigoi, all rules get amended? Why the heck is he the only person who shows some compassion amongst all the strigois we know?. Please don’t tell me because he’s Dimitri. THAT IS THE WRONG ANSWER. THIS HAS TO BE THE BIGGEST CLICHÉ TO EVER HAPPEN IN THE HISTORY OF ROMANCE. OMG I DON’T WANT TO PUKE -.-<br/><br/>•	<B>Adrian</b><br/><br/>Can we all just take a moment and appreciate the fact that Adrian is, in fact, one of the best things to happen to this series.? He is super cool. He uses spirit. He is quiet emotional even if he tries to be the most annoying person in front of everybody he cares for and doesn’t. And ya’all have to know that such people are my favorite kind. (Yeah, remember Delilah Bard?) <br/>And to whoever thinks he just wants to get Rose in bed, please open your eyes and start to count all the things he has done for her just because she wanted it, not because she asked him to, and not because he could. He’s just so cutesy and lovable and I wish Mead gave him more chance in the series. He needs a bigger role  _/\_<br/><br/>•	<b>Christian</b><br/><br/>…. is my next favorite. Correction- my first favorite character. See how I skipped all the main characters and settled for these two here? Because Mead’s characters are all appealing until she decides to put them on the spotlight.<br/><br/><b><i>Anyone who could make a joke at Adrian’s expense ranked high on Christian’s list</b></i> <br/><br/>Christian is a side character, but an important one. He is a badass, unafraid, insecure, is faulty for all the right reasons and I just love him because he can be so sweet at times. I especially had loved his connection with Rose in Frostbite, but then on Mead kind of decided to put him on rest. AND I AM NOT HAPPY. Why can’t there be more of Christian and Adrian even?. Why does it have to be always about Rose, Rose and Rose and (oh I almost forgot) an awful lot of Dimitri? Let’s all unite for Christian and please LET THERE BE MORE OF HIM IN THE UPCOMING BOOKS, because, let’s face it, he’s damn charming.<br/><br/>Also, I love this love-hate relationship between Adrian and Christian. Their banter is so so adorable and hilarious!<br/><br/><blockquote><b><i>Adrian was more eager than she was to discuss it – probably in the hopes of impressing Avery-and provided a quick rundown of some of spirit’s abilities, like auras and compulsion.<br/>“And,” he added, “I can visit people in their dreams.”<br/>Christian held up a hand. “Stop. I can feel there’s a comment coming on about how women already dream about you. I just ate, you know.”<br/>“I wasn’t going to go there,” said Adrian. But he kind of looked like he wished he’d thought of the joke first.</b></i></blockquote><br/><br/>See? I told you! They’re adorable!<br/><br/>•	<b>Lissa</b><br/><br/>Blood Promise is the fourth book in the series. And Vasilissa Dragomir is one of the two protagonists. So I must know something about her, hmm? Aside from the fact that she is the last in the Dragomir line and that she specializes in spirit, I honestly don’t have much idea about her. Because that is how<b> underdeveloped and inconsistent</b> her character is. Concentrating on Rose and deeming her to be the badass heroine every famous YA book these days sells upon, Richelle Mead seems to truly have forgotten she had another main character. Lissa has so less roles in the events of the book. Like I said, the non-existent romance managed to override every compelling plotline this story had. <br/><br/>And I don’t even like Lissa tbh. I don’t even know what I don’t like about her. Or probably that is just the reason I don’t like her. She is just so flat and bland and pushed aside by the author herself, that I haven’t actually gave much thought to her character. Uh, yeah. Whatever. She can be ignored and no one’s gonna mind.<br/><br/>•	<b>Janine Hathaway</b><br/><br/>If anyone has grown a bone AND a great character over the books, it’s got to be Janine Hathaway aka Rose’s mom. She is genuinely a surprise because I never thought she would be around much anymore and yeah her presence is a comfort as much to us as it is to Rose :)<br/><br/>I think that would be enough. This already has become my lengthiest review (I don’t get why I have so much to say about why I HATED a book but nothing about the book I LOVED?) Okay, don’t bother answering that. <br/><br/>So issuing my verdict, if you have come this far in the series, you might as well want to pick this up, because it’s in the same league as Mead’s previous books (only, I didn’t like this one). But I can also say, it is safe to avoid this book and continue towards its sequel, imo. Also considering the load of rewinding Mead’s gonna pull off in the next book, you probably wouldn’t even miss a thing. Come on now, I’m being honest! Skip it, read something else or go for the synopsis if you wish. There is nothing more you’re going to get by reading this book except maybe a few wasted hours?",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I also managed to read up to 10 books of the   Sweet Valley High series by Francine Pascal (stopping finally when it felt repetitive), marveling at how easy and relatable they were to read. But Private just didn’t make it. It was an easy read, but the story was just out of place, I’m not sure I’ll read the rest or give it another chance.<br/><br/><u>THE STORY</U><br/><br/>Private tells the story through the eyes of Reed Brennan, who is admitted to Easton Academy, one of the top-ranked institutions in the country. Reed had never had many friends at her old school, so she wants to fit in at Easton real bad. She meets Constance, her blabbering roommate, and with her, the Billboard Girls. They’re the ‘cool’ girls at Easton’s. They live in a separate dormitory, excel at basically everything, and have colleges lined up behind them. <br/><br/>Reed somehow gets invited to sit for lunch with them once, and she is determined to do all it takes to stay. But Thomas, the boy she has a crush on, thinks that the Billboard girls are not worth her time and the girls in turn, thinks he is a douchebag. But Reed wants to make it all work, make the two odd ends meet.<br/><br/><U>WHY IT WAS BAD</U><br/><br/>○▪ <b>Reed.</b> The main protagonist was the narrator of the story but she didn’t even make her presence noticeable. She had very few dialogues and her personality, I’d rather not say. She is a spineless, self-depreciating idiot. Her obsessive stalking of the Billboard Girls was annoying, and so was the way she practically threw herself at Thomas. I’m sorry, but I prefer charismatic, confident girls. For me, Reed’s voice was just bland and forced.<br/><br/>○▪ <b>The plot was a bit overdone.</b>  Everything was just about the Billboard girls and how cool they were (for reasons beyond me) and in the whole fuss, Reed just muted into the background.<br/><br/>○▪ <b>Character development was zero.</b> I’d falsely hoped that as the story progressed, Reed would pull herself up, grow a bit of confidence. But no, she was just the same as was everyone else.<br/><br/><u>WHAT WAS GOOD ABOUT IT</U><br/><br/>○▪ <b>Constance, Reed’s roommate. </b>She was the only fairly lovable character I could cling to, but she barely made any appearance throughout the book.<br/><br/>○▪<b>The genre.</b> The first reason I felt compelled to read this book. But this book belongs to the lower caste of the genre.<br/><br/>○▪ <b>The fact that it got over quickly.</b><br/><br/><img src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/aCibltbaDuT2E/giphy.gif""><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Nothing exciting, nothing to keep me hooked. The concept was good, but the writing was just okay-ish.<br/><br/><b>Darcie </b>lives with her father, who researches ancient history. With a job that required him to travel all over the world, Darcie was mostly homeschooled. When she returns to Maine, she is eager to meet her friends Marie and her brother Kevin, who has been her crush since high school. But her attempt at normal life ends when she runs into the Immortal brothers - Thane, Lome and Des. She is mistaken to be the soulmate of Des by Thane, Lome and all other Immortals, but Des denies that she is The One. Darcie is taken to their home in Greece, where she learns of the life and history of Immortals, their quest for power, and the rebellion which has been building up against the trio. Either, she has to trust her abductors and stay wih them, or question their intentions and risk her life by returning home.<br/><br/><b><u>Thoughts</u></b><br/><br/>(*) <b>The writing wasn't great.</b> Maybe it's the mistake of the ebook or something, but the writing was incredibly plain. It sounded too childish, but that improved as the book progressed. And there were also some grammar errors in the beginning. The repeated use of 'the teenager', 'the young girl', 'the petite blond', to refer to the characters  made for an uncomfortable read. All the time, I was like, ""Yeah, there comes the brunette"" or ""Uh-huh, she's still a teenager"". Honestly, it was unappealing. The lack of mastery in the use of pronouns and nouns is depicted clearly. Here's an example - <br/><i>""The young woman tilted her head and used her dark, round eyes to observe Darcie""</i> <u>Now imagine 'the young woman' in every other sentence, while she's still there.</u> You get my point? <br/><br/>(*) <b>The concept for the story was imaginative.</b> Even if controversial, the idea of Immortals seemed interesting. But I think, it could have been a bit more developed, like making an entire universe, instead of just another species would've worked better or something. I don't know, it's just a thought. <br/><br/>(*)<b>The plot lacked substance.</b> There wasn't much happening in the story. I was oddly reminded of [b:The Twilight Saga|3090465|The Twilight Saga (Twilight, #1-4)|Stephenie Meyer|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327930511s/3090465.jpg|6440505], and [b:Dark Promise|15765786|Dark Promise (Between Worlds, #1)|Julia Crane|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1343025776s/15765786.jpg|21469969] while reading the book (both were well-written compared to this one btw). The plot was eerily similar. Paranormal beings, an awkward teen, a (possible) love traingle, abduction, attempt at murder, saved at the last moment - all felt the same. <br/><br/>(*)<b>The charcaters.</b> The characters aren't all that well-developed, but I can see that might happen in the next book. Also, even if Darcie might not have been the best of heriones, I loved the way the author used her charcater to answer the reader's questions. Like, a moment we would be reading something and a doubt pops to mind, we'd find Darcie asking the same. It made her more relateable and interesting.<br/><br/><b>Overall this book wasn't anything extraordinary, </b>a bit confusing at times and <s>I might just pick up the next book, <i>MIGHT.</i></s>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Dhampirs are The Guardians, Morois are the royal and non-royal blood-drinkers, and Strigois are the immortals – the evil ones. <br/><br/><u>THE PLOT</u><br/><br/>Vasilissa is a princess of the Moroi world. She runs away with her guardian Rose to lead life among the humans, but they are found and brought back to St. Vladimir’s Academy. The Academy focuses on teaching morals and survival skills to the Dhampirs and Morois. The Morois are in constant threat from the Strigois, who are determined to overpower them and rule the world. <br/><br/>Rose and Lissa are connected by a telepathic bond. Lissa has secret powers which might make her a star, or a target. Rose has to learn everything she can from her personal instructor Dimitri – on whom she has a crush on – to keep Lissa safe. But from what? Why are they constantly threatened? Who is behind the threats?<br/><br/><u>MY THOUGHTS</u><br/><br/>- <b>Rose.</b> One of the most <b>unlikeable</b> protagonists I’ve read in a while. Her character was highly judgemental, hypocritic, and even with all these characteristics  - one-dimensional.<br/><br/>She is a complete anti-feministic feminist. Her reckless attitude is very much forced, her obsession with boys borders on slutty, and her objectification of woman bodies is unforgiveable. I mean, look at this? – <br/><br/><b><i><blockquote>Here, among the slim and small-chested Moroi girls, certain features—meaning my larger breasts and more defined hips—stood out. I knew I was pretty: but to Moroi boys, my body was more than just pretty: it was sexy in a risqué way. Dhampirs were an exotic conquest, a novelty all Moroi boys wanted to “try”.</blockquote></b></i><br/><br/>- <b>Lissa.</b> An important character with no redeeming qualities, has very little ‘actual’ role in the book. She was given so little part in the story that I really don’t know anything to say about her character. But atleast, the times she did make an appearance, she was much more tolerable and likeable than Rose.<br/><br/>- <b>The plot.</b>  Not much actually happened in the book, until the end. The ending was quite surprising and executed well compared to the rest of the story. But for most part, the book is just a high-school chick-flick drama, about boys and parties and sex, usual girl-girl banters and crush-on-teacher sorta things. There was lot less action than expected. The plot, to me, seemed like strands picked up from fantasies like Harry Potter, Twilight and Shades of Magic series. <br/><br/>- <b>The narrative.</b> Narrated from Rose’s pov, I felt that the whole plot lacked an esteem which otherwise could have been better. Like, there is very little focus on world-building and character development. Rose’s tone doesn’t match with the whole atmosphere which is paranorlmal-istic. But her narration was interesting too, straight-to-the-point and easy to follow. The writing was good, but it would have suited a contemporary book better, rather than a fantasy.<br/><br/><b>Overall, this book was an interesting read, suitable for fans of Twilight series. The characters were a bit flat, but plotwise, it was promising and just managed to convince me to pick up the next book.<br/><br/><br/>",,,2,,,0,,,,,

I really hated her in the beginning, but as the story progressed, it was easier to see why she was the way she was. <br/><br/>○•<b>I loved Eadlyn’s brothers.</b> Ahren was a sweetheart and was happy for him <spoiler>when he eloped with Camille, and left the shadow of his sister. She WAS a bit controlling</spoiler>. Kaden was a genius - a cute geek and Osden was a lovable prankster. The relationship they had between them was adorable.<br/><br/>○•<b>The life of the royalty was potrayed unrealistically.</b> I think the author downplayed the role of a king and queen in a monarchy. It was made to feel as if their only duty was to dress up and look good for the public. (Yes, there was paperworks and stuff mentioned, but it still doesn’t make a clear point of how tough it actually is to rule a country.)<br/><br/>○•<b>It simply lacked a good plot. </b>The whole selection process was repeated, and while it wasn’t all that boring, it just wasn’t exciting or anything new. I would’ve expected more thought, something interesting to happen, but it didn’t. But where it lacks in creativity, it makes up with comfort. I guess that’s the whole point of this book, a nostalgic trip through The Selection lane.<br/><br/><blockquote><i><b>I knew the water would get rid of the mess, and I knew it would take away the smell, but no amount of scrubbing would ever wash away this memory.</b></i></blockquote><br/><br/><b>All things considered, </b>The Heir is not my favorite book of the series, it just was a comfortable read. For anyone who enjoyed the first three books, this book might be appealing, but otherwise, I’d advice not to bother.<b>2.5/5 stars</b>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I had braced myself for possibilities of surprises and action, but there was none.<br/><br/><b>OVERVIEW</b> <br/>Dark Promise is a paranormal romance. Rylie McCallister is a soon-to-be sixteen year old. Her parents are loving and supportive, so is her best friend. Her boyfriend Adam is the most caring and handsome guy. Basically her life is just perfect, until it's not.<br/><br/>The day before her sixteenth birthday, a strange woman named Azura visits her family and reveals to her that she is actually her daughter. Not a human, but a 'light faery'. Her transformation would be complete on her sixteenth birthday, when she'll sprout wings, her ears will become pointed, and her skin flawless. Her name is actually Oleander. The star-shaped birthmark on her forehead wasn't a normal birthmark, but the sign of an Aurorian faery with special powers. Her real faery father had promised her to Varwik, the leader of the dark faery world hoping to gain access to the powers of the dark faeries. Not wanting her daughter to be given to the dark world, Azura had traded her daughter to the newborn dead daughter of the McCallisters to make Varwik believe that she died in birth. She has been watching Rylie grow ever since. <br/><br/>Azura warns Rylie that once she becomes a faery, other faeries could detect her and the dark faery would come after her. Soon enough, the day after her sixteenth birthday, Rylie is kidnapped by dark faeries and bought to Varwik's castle. Varwik offers her an impossible choice - either die and let her powers die with her, or marry his seventeen year old son Kallan. <br/><br/>Rylie is stuck between the two worlds. She badly wants to return home, and she misses Adam. But Kallan doesn't seem like a bad guy. What would she do? What were her powers that Varwik was so afraid of? How could she survive?<br/><br/><b>THOUGHTS</b><br/>The starting was slow. The prologue practically tells the whole story, so there are no surprises. <br/>All the first few chapters, Rylie talks about her perfect life, and it was damn boring. And next when she transforms into a faery, for about ten pages we're in front of the mirror. <br/>The romance was cheesy. There was absolutely no chemistry between Adam and Rylie. They couldn't stand each other for five seconds without kissing. Everyone else was like,<br/><br/><img src=""http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/meh_emma_stone.gif"" width=350 height=200><br/><br/>So, it was after 70% of the book, that the story actually moved on. The story had so much potential, but the author focused solely on the sloppy romance. I wish the author hadn't brought on a love triangle and instead gave us some more insight to the faery world. The dark faery world didn't seem all that dark, and Oleander was actually roaming the gardens when she was suposed to a prisoner. (Don't worry these aren't even spoilers). <br/><br/>The characters lacked depth, except maybe Kallan. Rylie was the least lovable one. And her parents, the McCallisters, the way they took the news of their daughter being a faery surprisingly and unbelievably well, was unrealistic.<br/><br/><b>VERDICT</b><br/>All said, the story lacked purpose halfway through the book and became yet another love triangle. But because I'm human and I am curious, I just might pick up the sequel.<br/><br/><img src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/NWg7M1VlT101W/giphy.gif"" width=350 height=200>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

What kinda name is that?) is a 'four' in the country of Illèa, where people are divided by castes, as numbers. When the letter arrives at her house, stating she would be one of the many woman competing to be the queen, her family is excited. Prince Maxon would chose from one of the thirty five young ladies who make it to the Selection to be his queen, and the family of the girl would directly be promoted as Ones. But America isn't excited at the prospect of leaving her loving and handsome boyfriend Aspen, a Six, to compete to be the queen of someone she doesn't even know.<br/>She hesitantly signs the letter at her family and Aspen's insistance and is surprised when she is selected. America and the thirty five other selected girls would have to stay at the palace during the course of the Selection. When Aspen breaks up with her saying she deserves more than him, America is heartbroken. And Prince Maxon isn't as boring as she thought. But when Aspen turns up at the palace, she has to make the decision - either accept him and throwaway her chances, or be the queen and live a luxurious life.<br/><br/><b>My thoughts -</b><br/>◇• <b>The writing style was incredibly smooth, albeit plain.</b> I loved that it never got boring to read even when the story dragged out a bit. <br/><br/>◇•<b>The story was dull and lacking in substance.</b> To me it was just a dystopia, weaved up from the fame of the likes like [b:The Hunger Games|2767052|The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, #1)|Suzanne Collins|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1447303603s/2767052.jpg|2792775].

There was nothing new, which was what I had hoped while diving into the story.<br/><br/>◇•<b>There was little to no focus on relationships. </b> There was really no relations present, with maybe one exception of America and her sister. Throughout the story, what we ever get to see is America and her problems. Thankfully, she didn't come across as whiny. <br/><br/>◇•<b>The ending.</b> I felt kind of cheated. Nothing really happened in the story. We MUST read the next book to make a sense of anything that has happened. I hate it when we are forced to read sequels. It is unfair! The ending was this big cliffhanger that you really HAVE to read the next book. <spoiler>The story ends when the group of selected girls are down to six.</spoiler> <br/><br/><b>Overall,</b> this book was an easy, likable read. I liked the main character enough to make me curious as to what happens next.

I know I liked it, but I also know that it wasn’t enough. This trilogy gave me characters I love so much, but I don’t want that attachment to pollute my actual opinion that this book <b>WASN’T GOOD ENOUGH</B> . <br/><br/>With the overwhelming feeling I had after reading AGoS, (you can check my review of it <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2069147792"">here)</a>, I had set my expectations higher for this, and if you can’t tell yet, I’m a bit disappointed.<br/><br/><b><u>THE PLOT</U> </b><br/><br/>The story starts just the moment where the second book stops. <br/><br/><b>Red London is falling.</b><br/><br/>Magic and Power is a deadly combination. The Shadow King, in a grim determination to take over the kingdom, has brought darkness all over the place. His magic is dark and powerful, and it would take more than one <i>Antari</i> and a definite amount of planning to defeat him.<br/><br/>Kell, Lila, Holland and Alucard have discovered a way to defeat Osaron aka The Shadow King, and in their search for a magical artifact, their quest to bring back peace and order, they find power, trouble, witness more than one death AND learn their strengths and weaknesses. <br/><br/><u><b>MY THOUGHTS</b></u><br/><br/>The best thing about this book? Undoubtedly,<br/><br/><b>HOLLAND</b><br/><br/>If the first book was mostly about Kell, and the second book about Lila, in this book we get to see Holland quite often. And unlike Kell and Lila, there is a heartbreaking backstory which brings in all the mystery, grief, and adds an insurmountable depth to Holland’s character.<br/><br/><blockquote><b> Holland said nothing, but made his way straight toward the hold. Lila watched him go.<br/><i> I still don’t trust you, </i>she thought.<br/>As if he could feel the weight of her gaze, Holland glanced back over his shoulder.<br/><i>You do not know me, </i>his gaze seemed to say.<br/><i>You do not know me at all.<br/></i></b></blockquote><br/><br/>I loved every moment of his presence, his slightly arrogant attitude, his demeanor, and the more everyone showed their distaste for him, the more I loved him. <br/><br/><blockquote><b><i> <br/>“What?” demanded Holland.<br/>“It’s nice,” said Kell, “to meet someone like me.”<br/>Holland frowned. “I am not like you,” he said, and walked away.<br/></i></b></blockquote><br/><br/>But I’m so very disappointed at the way his story ended. We never got to see a moment where he actually <b>lived his own life.</b> Schwab used his character and carved out a tragic-hero kinda story for him and it is just so unfair! Holland, the Antari, the invincible one, <b>deserved better. So much better.</b> He definitely does not deserve to be the author’s puppet to be used against us, to be a tear-jerking plot device. <b>NO. Just NO</b> <br/><br/><blockquote><b><i><br/>The bodies piled. Athos watched. Astrid grinned.<br/>Holland’s hand moved on its puppet string.<br/>And his mind screamed until it finally lost its voice.<br/></i></b></blockquote><br/><br/>Almost half the time I cried through this book (that is still a lot!), it was for Holland. AND I JUST CAN’T GET ENOUGH OF HIM, I NEEEEED MOOOREE. <B>PLEASE SCHWAB, REWRITE THE STORY BEFORE IT GETS ETCHED IN MY MEMORYYY</B><br/><br/>Another good thing about this book, <b>the depth of the relationships.</b> This is not just about the romantic interests, I’m talking about the general bond of the characters with each other. It was so so good, and so full of emotions. No it isn’t like they are meant to actually be this deep, but it kinda just happened. Over the course of the books, the bond between the characters HAVE GROWN INTO YOU, THAT <B>YOU CAN JUST FEEL IT OOZING OFF THE PAGE</B>. Like, the bond between Kell-Holland, Alucard-Kell, Rhy-Alucard, Lila-Holland and even most of the side characters like Hastra and Lenos. <b>The characterization is brilliant, mesmerizing.</b><br/><br/><b><i><blockquote>""You know, I still don’t like you"" said Kell.<br/>Alucard breathed in relief. ""Don’t worry, the feeling is mutual""<br/></blockquote></i></b><br/><br/>Okay, now that we have got the Holland and the relationships part, let’s move forward shall we? <br/><br/>As always, <b>Schwab’s writing was amazing.</b> But the thing is, when the whole thing comes down to the <b>STORY</b> everything crashes down. Because, this book is almost 700 pages long and the story it tells could actually have been a 300 pages or less. <b>That is how non-existent and downplayed it is.</b><br/><br/>We have this huge villain, <b>The Shadow King</b>, but I really can’t think of that many reasons why he is terrible. Osaron’s character, at one point simply seemed like a whining child, a kid claiming to be an adult. And since he was supposedly the main plot device, it just didn’t work out. <br/><br/>Sometimes the story seemed dragged-out, some parts were really unnecessary.<b> And the suspense, the climax? It was the biggest disappointment.</b> Every moment I felt the plot crumbling, I kept telling myself that the ending would be worth it, that the climax would blow me away. <B> BUT THE THING IS, THE WHOLE BOOK BUILDS UP SO VERY SLOWLY UPTO THAT POINT, AND IT JUST KINDA BROKE DOWN WITH THE WEIGHT.</B><br/><br/>The plot devices here were really very few –<b> a villain, an idea to kill him, a journey to work it out, death, death and more death (which were all unnecessary), and finally the unequivocal ‘Happily Ever-After’.</b> I don’t know, but 700+ pages of a promising story which it failed to deliver has made me annoyed.<br/><br/><u>Some of the other things that went through my mind-</u><br/>▪ The portrayal of religion is done in a real, subtle way. It gives the readers a chance to comprehend it whichever way they want. And I applaud Schwab for that.<br/>▪ Did anyone notice that, Alucard is Dracula spelt backward? <br/>▪ I couldn’t help thinking why Osaron, a piece of magic gone horribly wrong, was repeatedly mentioned as ‘he’, I mean it isn’t even human right?<br/>▪ The three Antaris are so much similar in a way. I mean, they’re all the most powerful magicians in the world, but no one thirsts for power. All they need and ask for is FREEDOM. And that’s awesome.<br/>▪ Even if Kell doesn’t want to, I still need to know his past. Schwab could have given it as a side story. What would people think if I say Kell is one of my favorite characters but I don’t have any idea about his past? -.-<br/>▪ Also what about Lila? What’s the deal with her? How did she get the brown eye? There could have been some more details of her past too.<br/>▪ Rhy’s character development is amazing!<br/>▪ I couldn’t help comparing this trilogy to HP. All the similarities!<br/><br/><b>Overall, </b> This book was an enjoyable read. Sure I wasn’t totally satisfied and there were parts that could have been better. But I did love the way it wrapped up. I love the characters.<br/>Now that I’ve completed the trilogy, it is safe to say that it is nowhere as good as the Harry Potter series, but it does stand alone on its own. <b>3.5/5 stars.<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

But then Mead just took a leap and wrote a wonderful sequel. THIS BOOK. I’m not saying this was absolutely riveting. But comparing to the first book, I can safely say, this series is definitely getting better. <b>4/5 stars</b><br/><br/>The book takes off with a new attack on the Moroi world, by the evil Strigois –immortal vampires –who are trying to gain power by aiming the Royals one by one. To keep everyone safe, and to have a moment of fun, the students and staff at St. Vladimir’s, along with the royal families go on a skiing trip. They stay at a well-guarded luxurious resort. <br/><br/>Rose, being tutored by Dimitri, is working on honing her self-control and defense skills. Lissa, the last of the Dragomirs, is still on pills to keep her magic down, her spirit in control. Meanwhile, Mason, who has a huge crush on Rose decides to act on an impulse to take off some Strigois. He leaves off to town, with two others. Rose, along with Christian, Lissa’s boyfriend hunts them down and finds them. On their way back though, they are kidnapped by Strigois. How will they escape? What do the Strigois want?<br/><br/>Be prepared for some cool action and adventure. The beginning as usual, is a dragged on, dramatic high-school stuff. But throughout this drama, Mead builds up a really good foundation for the action in the end. I am starting to love this style of hers. The ending had me at edge. <br/><br/>Rose’s character development is amazing. But sometimes, she just switches personalities, in the span of a moment. It was a bit unrealistic and difficult to follow. The writing style has improved vastly, and I can see the book has developed a sense of purpose which it completely lacked in the first book. Even if the plot is highly predictable, the characters act totally oblivious to the twists. It was a bit annoying at times. <br/><br/>What I loved the most? – The understanding and chemistry between Rose and Christian. THAT WAS SO FREAKING GOOD. I was literally screaming my head off during those scenes. The ending was mindblowing. Predictable, yes. But it was very thrilling, a definite mind-effer. And MASON. My God! I didn’t realize he was my favorite person until the end. Mead unabashedly crushed my heart. <br/>Why didn’t I get more of Christian?? He was absent for most part of the book. I loved every moment of his presence! Also, I might not be the biggest fan of Dimitri and Rose together. Duh. <br/><br/><b>Overall,</b> a brilliant sequel to the first book in what I hope would be a really good series. I have to read the rest of the books soon. Also, I forgot to mention, EVEN IF YOU DIDN’T READ THE FIRST BOOK, YOU CAN SAFELY START WITH THIS ONE. The prologue is pretty much all you need to know about the series. Good Luck!<br/><br/>P.S Sorry, this review is more of a rambling. If you are still reading this, Thank You for putting up with my lack of organizing skills! ;)",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It still has so much bottled potential, so many unexplored territories that I can’t wait to read and discover more. Seriously, I never thought I was going to love this series. But Mead has a really consistent pattern of writing, of story-building, that I have gotten used to – it’s rhythmic, comfortable, adrenaline-jerking and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Shadow Kiss takes on after the events in Frostbite. The Strigoi attacks on the ski-trip had been unnerving. But this time, Rose and the elder Dhampirs have to go through the field experience – their final test before they can be officially declared as guardians. In the Field experience, Dhampirs are assigned to Moroi royals and have to follow them around like a real guardian. The test is when real Guardians dressed as Strigois pop up unexpectedly and test their reflexes and strength.<br/><br/>Rose is furious when she gets assigned to Christian instead of Lissa. But it doesn’t matter however, since those two are inseparable. Meanwhile, Rose’s love life is turning out more and more confusing. Adrian and Lissa start practicing their spirit-induced powers together and this gets Christian jealous. On the other hand, some of the Moroi royals have ganged up and started practicing magic for defense. <br/>Rose has a tough life, with field experience, her perpetual visions of Mason’s ghost and Strigoi attacks that come at all the wrong time and wreak havoc like it has never before.  <br/><br/><b><u>My Thoughts:</b></u><br/><br/>- I am starting to like Rose for real. Her <b>character development knows no bounds.</b><br/>- Like, she is such a badass and at the same time she feels so realistic.<br/>- Ah, and how about all <b>other characters?</b><br/>- Like, Christian.<br/>- I SO LOVE HIM<br/>- But no, Mead forgot him for most part of the story.<br/>- Why is there so less of so many characters?<br/>- For instance, take Adrian.<br/>- He may be spoilt all he wants, but HE IS MY FAVOURITE.<br/>- Like, why is he even sticking up for Rose?<br/>- And who knew, he had such a kind li’l heart in there?<br/>- And that thing with Dimitri?<br/>- I suspected it, since like, the FIRST BOOK?<br/>- But that ending though? Ah, never in my dreams, ever.<br/>- But still, why is this whole thing turned into just Romance and it’s after-effects in the end?<br/>- I mean, there are bigger problems in the world, and all Rose wants to do is <spoiler>hunt a near-dead Dimitri?</spoiler><br/>- Sorry though, I will never get this thing about Love.<br/>- Did I mention the whole book was like, COMPLETELY PREDICTABLE?<br/>- Also, I’m quite sure I forgot to mention how much I want to read the next book.<br/>- So yeah, you get the picture ;)<br/>- Thanks for going through this with me, you can move on haha",,,1,,,0,,,,,

But what the book unfurled before me was something I could've never imagined. <br/><br/>Kate is a war reporter who has returned home to Herne Bay to set some affairs straight after the death of her mother. Her dad was a drunkard who beat her mom and her. After his death, her younger sister Sally becomes an alcoholic, resulting in her daughter Hannah running away from home. Sally's husband Paul has a hard time controlling her.<br/><br/>But Kate is haunted by her days in Syria. She has nightmares of the little boy Nidal, who she had become close to, and unfortunately died infront of her. As if the nightmares weren't enough, Kate sees a little boy in the house next door inhabited by an Iraqi refugee who denies she has children and insists her husband is away. She has a hard time separating dreams and realities and Paul helps her cope with it. Kate and Sally must reconcile their differences and learn the truth about their brother's death.   <br/>But after Kate leaves to Syria, she is reported dead. Sally must now do all that Kate has left undone in Herne Bay.<br/><br/>The novel started with a slow pace. Maybe it's my inexperience with psychological thrillers, but I felt kinda weird reading this; the beginning was slow and dragging, and then it suddenly becomes emotionally gripping to the point that I was forced to question my own sanity. The second half was a suspense thriller that kept me on edge and I gladly traded my precious night's sleep to find out what was going on.<br/><br/>The concept was really interesting.  The author, without even trying hard, manages to convince us of the brutality of war. Kate's story seems impossible yet couldn't be more real. The novel gives us an insight into the life of a war reporter and the stress that goes with it. From all the war novels I've read, none of them had me convinced as well as this one of the affect of war on people. And it is not even a war novel!<br/><br/>Nuala Ellwood has done a brilliant job with the characters. Each of them has a realistic touch. It feels like we're living their life, especially of Kate and Sally. It's almost scary.<br/><br/>It is not so often that you come across a book, that grips you tight, twists your mind and churns your stomach, and yet makes you see the world for what it truly is. My Sister's Bones was one such book for me. If I wasn't put off by the writing style at the beginning of the book (it's not bad. It was just me, really!) I would've given it five stars.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Till now, all they did was be for each other and try to pick up  evidences against the killer. But every evidence points to one of them. They must figure out who it is, before the remaining people on the list are attacked.<br/><br/>I had my doubts about the killer, in the beginning of the first book itself. And this book made it clear from the start that I was right. Yet, till the last page, it churned my mind to pulp. I was literally gasping all the way. Sara Shepard sure knows how to play with the minds of her readers. <br/><br/>The plot twist came out of nowhere, and I will have to reread the whole series now to make complete sense of it <spoiler>Turns out, Julie and Parker are the same people. Parker died a year ago and Julie suffered from an identity disorder, where she thought she was Parker and Julie at the same time.</spoiler>. Though, it does seem to have clichés, and the ending seemed a bit confusing, this book was an intense read all the same. <br/><br/>For all the mystery, thriller or even YA fans, this series is certainly not one to be missed.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

She really is a kind of her own making.<br/><br/><b>The Guard</b> is an insight into the tough life of Aspen as the palace guard. His take on the whole Selection process and hearing his side of the story was very refreshingly beautiful. His endless passion for all things is obvious. I loved the way he analyzed things in his own way, even if he wasn’t always right.  Like, what he thought of King Clarkson -<br/><blockquote><b><i>""Of course the man with everything he could ever need or want didn’t understand why any average person might want the same chance”</b></i></blockquote><br/><br/>Or about America’s dad – <br/><blockquote><b><i>'Out of the millions of words in the world, Mr. Singer always seemed to know how to pick the handful that made you feel like you mattered.’</b></i> </blockquote><br/><br/>That’s so very true! (As was seen in Mr. Singer’s letters to America) <br/><br/>I was stunned to see how perfectly Kiera Cass has worded each feeling and thoughts, and made them unbelievably real. This book was so<u> beautifully written,</u> I am slapping myself for ever doubting Cass’s mastery of words. She has this simple, lyrical prose, and yet she manages to hold so much depth and emotions in the very handful of the words she uses.<br/><br/>There was one thing I noticed though, like this – <br/><i>I swear, I wanted to give my girl a medal.’</i> I mean, what is there to swear about? Such sentences were a bit repetitive. Not that I mind them :)<br/><br/>Through this book, I’ve also learned much more of the setting of The Selection. The rebel attacks as seen through the eyes of Aspen differ so much from America’s pov. Hearing about them from America sitting in a safe room wasn’t all that informative it seems!<br/><br/>I also was wondering how Aspen and Lucy became close, or how they could ever be a good match for each other – but this book has vanquished such doubts too. I can see for myself now, that they were meant to be.<br/><br/>Only problem with this book? Well, I really wished it was a bit longer. There were so many things I would have loved to see through Aspen’s eyes. Like, the end of the selection, America and Aspen’s marriage, or his reaction when he finds Marlee and Carter were still in the palace. Nevertheless, I can’t complain. It was just really good. <b>4.5/5 stars</b>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It is VERY annoying when you are the last person on earth to read a book that’s been talked about for ages. It just plays with your mind, making you try and force yourself to like the book and be in everyone’s good books while constantly praying you don’t hate it, so as not to be the target of the immense fandom.<br/><br/><img src=""http://31.media.tumblr.com/19ca5b0c9c74fdf06d4d6a2bf6bc4b99/tumblr_na52hjPS8U1sgl0ajo1_400.gif""><br/><br/><b>But I loved this book.</b> It had its issues, yes, but in the end, I felt deprived and needy. I’m glad that ADSoM did that to me. I love it when books invoke such feelings.<br/><br/>EVERYONE knows what this book is about, but for ‘some’ of the everyone who don’t, I’ll summarize it for you :<br/><br/><b>There are four Londons in a parallel universe, <br/></b>recognized by color  – Grey (where magic is rare and people are ‘normal’), Red (where magic thrives along with its people), White (where magic is used to conquer and kill; ruled by the evil twins – Astrid and Athos Dane)  and Black (once was full of magic and power; now extinct). These Londons have gateways from one to other, but only <i>Antari’s</i> can pass through them. They are a rare breed – only two are known, <b>Kell</b> and <b>Holland.</b><br/><br/>Kell is of Red London and Holland is enslaved to the evil twin rulers of White London. They travel through the Londons carrying messages to and from the royals. But Kell has a habit of smuggling things, which his so-called brother <b>Prince Rhy </b>(of Red London) disapproves of. Kell is positive he won’t be caught, but then he is tricked, and ends up with the <i>Vitari</i> - a Black Stone – a powerful magical object from Black London. <br/><br/>Kell sets off to take the stone back to its native place, assisted by <b>Delilah Bard</b>, a gifted thief who is out to seek adventure. But he’s followed and attacked. Until the stone is discarded where no one can reach it, Kell and Lila would have to face the consequences.<br/><br/><u>THOUGHTS AT RANDOM</U><br/><br/>◇▪ <b>The concept was very imaginative.</b> The whole four-london-thing was really creative. And there were many other instances in the book which further proves Schwab’s creativity. <br/><br/>But the concept of MAGIC , with a LIFE OF ITS OWN was kinda scary. Like technology, maybe? We can be pretty much sure that it is consuming us, but if it had a life of its own, then humans are doomed. I felt the same here.<br/><br/>◇▪ <b>The writing was engrossing.</b> Even if the story started really slow, it picked up pace in the second half and was really entertaining to read.<br/><br/>◇▪ <b>It lacked depth and complexity.</b> I really wanted more of the world, the characters, of the world. But so less was offered. There isn’t much depth to the story. While the world-building is done carefully, it lacks in details. I need DEPTH, COMPLEXITY. I want to be able to describe all the Londons and it’s people in vivid detail, like I can about Hogwarts and the wizarding world. <br/><br/>◇▪ <b>That COAT.</B> No, I’m not talking about Kell’s coat here. It was wonderful, yes. But it isn’t possible to find one. What I want is Lila’s pirate coat. The one she bought from Calla. I. NEED. IT. <i>*says the girl with zero bank balance**sigh*</i><br/><br/>◇▪ <b>I hated the fact</b> that Antaris had to cut themselves to travel around Londons. It was gross and took time to get used to. <br/><br/><u>THE CHARACTERS</U><br/><br/>◇▪ <b>Kell wasn’t likeable.</b> I found it hard to relate to, or love the main character. HE WAS QUITE A BLAND CHARACTER. There isn’t much we know about him, but seeing that he has a mysterious past life, I hope it gets cleared in the next book. <br/><br/>◇▪ <b>Lila.</b> One of the best things about this book. I loved her badass-ery. She’s really adventurous (a bit too much), kinda stupid and clever at the same time. She was the only character, who I could see was quite well developed, besides Rhy.<br/><br/><i><blockquote>Rhy laughed silently. “I apologize for anything I might have done. I was not myself.”<br/>“I apologize for shooting you in the leg,” said Lila. “I was myself entirely.”</i></blockquote><br/><br/>◇▪ <b>Rhy.</b> He was the one, positive, normal, lovable character. Flirtatious. Handsome. Loyal.<br/>I ugly cried when he died. (Oops! Was that spoiler-y? I assure you not.)<br/><br/>◇▪ <b>Holland.</b> I can’t seem to pull together my thoughts about him. He was manipulated to do things, but he did it with such cruelty - it makes me hate him. And love him. And I-donno-what. He’s a confusing character, even if he made little appearance in the book.<br/><br/><b>All said, A Darker shade of Magic was a delightful read. A bit difficult to get into, but once you do, all you can think about is picking up the next book.<br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

But when boredom got the better of me, I picked it up, started reading, and finished it in a day. <br/><br/>This book was what prodded me into reading more. That interest, the way a book pulled me into its pages - It made me realize that there was a vast world within the pages of books, that I was yet to discover. J.K Rowling, you deserve every accolade you’ve received and more. <br/><br/>There’s no point in telling what this book is about, so I’ll just say what is so special about it.<br/><br/>--There’s seriously no one else who can write like Rowling. Her perfect prose, wit, and humor, is a trademark in its own right. <br/><br/>--J.K Rowling is nothing short of a genius. To plot such a story - intricate, full of details, so brilliantly planned out – I can’t even describe my fascination. Every time I read this, there’s a new detail, a point I earlier missed.

Our school library was so poorly stocked. The only books it held were the many different editions of classic books and THESE. Goosebumps books. I used to read them and love them then, but now, I don’t even want to think I used to love them once.<br/><br/> <b><u>The Plot</b></u><br/><br/>Amanda and Josh are not at all happy with their new house at Dark Falls. The town looks deserted, completely shady and eerie. But their parents insist the house is huge and cool. <br/>Creepy things happen to them, and the kids in the neighborhood act strange. One extraordinarily creepy night, they find that all those friends they made, are already dead. And they want Josh and Amanda dead too.. <br/><br/><b><u>Thoughts</b></u><br/><br/>- At one point, Amanda, the mc, thinks she’s more sensible and patient than her brother, BECAUSE SHE IS A GIRL<br/><br/>- Sounds reasonable right?  Duh. I don’t see why<b><i> boys aren’t considered sensible enough?</b></i><br/><br/>-The book was fairly readable, except, the writing was really uncool. Like, look at this –<br/><br/><blockquote><b> “Your basketball is packed in one of these cartons,” Dad was saying. Then Josh said something. Then Dad said, “How should I know which one?” Then Josh said something. Then Dad said, “No, I don’t have time to look now. Believe it or not, your basketball isn’t at the top of my list.”</b></blockquote><br/><br/>-Yeah that’s a <i>real</i> paragraph from the book. I CAN’T EVEN.. <br/><br/>-Seems like R.L Stine has memorized every bit of how-to-write-a-horror-story manual. He has <b><i>badly</i></b> used every supposedly-scary trope there is. <br/><br/>* Dog barking at dead people? ✔<br/>* Gross description of peeling skin and popping eyeballs? ✔<br/>* Melting bodies? ✔<br/>* Dead people afraid of light? <spoiler>What’s a halogen light, even?</spoiler> ✔<br/>* Venturing to the cemetery at night and considering it ‘adventure’? ✔<br/>* Century-old, nearly-dead trees? ✔<br/><br/>-But what I don’t really understand is the concept. It is ridiculous to say the least. Who on earth would agree moving to a house they supposedly inherited from a non-existent great-uncle? And, dead people living in a town? They aren’t even considered as ghosts. Why are they ‘dead’ then? What does dead mean? How come, they’re not anywhere else? If they’re already dead, what happens when they ‘melt away’? Ugh, questioning the plot devices of this book is sickening.<br/><br/><br/><b>In short,</b> if you decide to overlook the questionable plot and poor writing, this book might be enjoyable. Probably.",,,2,,,0,,,,,

Or you rate it one star, because one of the stories managed to piss you off in the most uncool fashion possible? Or do you just close your eyes and go by whichever rating the mouse is pointing at when you open your eyes? <br/>Ugh, goodreads rating system is so very overrated people!<br/><br/><br/>Now let’s steer back to this book. Here’s the deal. A booktuber challenges an author to write a villainy tale, and the author comes up with a matching story. The booktuber then comments on the story and the villain. <br/><br/>It is a collection of 13 short stories written by 13 famous (and not-so-famous) authors, who has awed us with their amazing books and had no business tending to short stories like the ones in here. Like, really, this book just about extinguished all my curiosity for short stories.<b> It was a literal placard showcasing how unsatisfying short stories can be. </b><br/><br/>Or probably, it was a matter of expectations – I started this book, because it promised us a tales from the villain’s pov. So I was like, OMG this is my kinda book, I love Villians! I mean who doesn’t love to get a glimpse of the actual person behind all those façade of a villain? Like, who has watched The Dark Knight without rooting for <b><i>The Joker </b></i>instead of <b><i>Batman</b></i>? There is just something mysteriously intriguing about villians which is why this book piqued up my interest.<br/><br/><b><i><blockquote>``We love to hate them and they hate to be loved, if only because being hated frees them from being good.’’ </b></i></blockquote><br/><br/>In a way, this book provides exactly what I expected it to. But what I forgot to consider was the fact that <B>every villain is the hero of their own story.</B> <br/><br/>Even if the whole concept was interesting, the execution failed to reach the readers. The booktubers comments felt totally unnecessary most of the times. The stories were made up like it was written just for completing the challenges. It lacked the originality I had expected with such an intriguing idea. Though some of the tales were really good, I’ve come to believe that whatever they say, short stories just don’t come up to full-length-novels. The characters are forgotten way too soon, the message goes awry and unrecognizable in a matter of moments. I may be wrong, but considering this book, I am completely right.<br/><br/>My favorite stories? – <br/>•	<b>Sera</b> by Nicola Yoon,  <br/>•	<b>Gwen and Art and Lance</b> by Soman Chainani, <br/>•	<b>Death Knell</b> by Victoria Schwab (because the writing was amazing), <br/>•	<b>You, You, it’s all about You</b> by Adam Silvera. <br/><br/>And yeah, as I said, the comments got repetitive and boring after a while, but the final one, <b>The  Bad Girls Guide to Villainy</b> by Steph Sinclair and Kat Kennedy was really cool! So there’s that. The villains are the heroes, some of the stories do nothing other than promote ‘villain-ism’ and the whole purpose of the story was kind of misinterpreted in one way or other. <br/><br/><br/>Now, say, how do I rate this book? Since it wasn’t COMPLETELY bad, and since I loved some of the stories, I’ll go with goodreads standards and rate it <b>2/5 stars (it was okay).</b> Read this if you have nothing better to read.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Why isn’t anyone else reading and raving about it? Just 85 ratings on goodreads?!  THAT’S THE WORST KIND OF DISRESPECT A BOOK THIS WELL-WRITTEN DOESN’T EVEN DESERVE. <br/>PLEASE, PEOPLE – GRAB THIS BOOK AND READ IT. YOU’LL BE GLAD YOU DID.<br/><br/><b>Yesterday, </b>as the title says, is a story of reincarnation. I’d thought it would be some cheesy, filmy romance, but no, it was amazing (romantic yes, but amazing all the same).<br/><br/><b>Amanda Parker</b> saves the life of <b>Mark Callahan</b> from a train accident, in front of an antique shop. Mark is instantly attracted to Amanda, but Amanda is less so. She is still mourning for the death of Joe, her boyfriend. Everyone she has ever loved has succumbed to death. She now lives with Mary, her godmother, who is a psychiatrist. Amanda has vowed to herself that she would never let herself close to anyone ever again. But Mark is not the one to give up.<br/><br/> Both of them have this daunting feeling that they know each other but also know that they have never met before. Through regression sessions with Mary, Amanda learns of a past life, where she was Bonnie, living in Chicago in the late 1800s. Bonnie’s life is similar to Amanda. Her loved ones had deceased. This makes her all the more reluctant to accept Mark. But fate has a way of revealing its most brilliant plan at times like these. Amanda and Mark’s life are intertwined by fate. Will Amanda let it loose?<br/><br/><b>THOUGHTS</B><br/><br/>I was instantly hooked up by this book in the beginning itself. It had a very Gone With The Wind feel to it which made it even more appealing. <br/><br/>The plot, even though quite simple, is executed perfectly. The way the narratives alternate between the past and present lives, makes you more and more curious. And the little details in this book, like the St. Michaels church, the angel bells, and many such important artifacts too, later revealed to be real, blew my mind. <br/><br/>The writing was pure bliss. It isn’t the easy-to-read, comfortable style you are familiar with, but the engrossing style we associate with classics. Amanda and Mark’s slight bickering was refreshing. <br/>Mark might come across as a dominant character, but he was a gentleman in true sense. Amanda’s reserved nature added mystery and depth to her character. I couldn’t find a fault with the character development, as hard as I did try.<br/><br/>There were some little issues though, which is the reason this was not a five-star read.<br/><br/>I wasn’t a fan of the constant romantic moments of the book, but because it was Mark and Amanda, it felt a bit more bearable. Amanda is very hesitant towards Mark at first, but she has no problem involving with him sexually. The kisses and cuddles, as hot as they were, seem pointless and overdone.<br/><br/>And also, <spoiler>It seems silly that Amanda didn’t recognize Daniel to be Mark right away. It was way too obvious.</spoiler><br/><br/>Also, there’s a cat named Electra, which seems to live a bit too longer than its natural lifespan. Maybe cats lived for 20 years in the 19th century? Ah I don’t know.<br/><br/><blockquote><i>Trees grow tall for the sake of the view.

No one knows who the monarchy is comprised of, or what it actually is. Only that they are the reason people have food on their plates and are taken care of. <br/><br/>Constance, being the elder daughter, is forced to join the brigade through a Removal Ceremony.

There are rebels in the sectors, and Constance has to fight people of her own sector, or else risk the hatred of the Monarchy.<br/><br/><u>My thoughts</u> -<br/>-The writing was good and easy to read. But it felt kind of detached at times. I found myself thinking of things while reading, which was a first for me. I need books to distract me, not be the source of my distraction.<br/><br/>-The plot was poorly thought out - unoriginal. There were many instances where events were just skipped past and are explained later. It was confusing, not to mention annoying.<br/><br/>-The character development was scarce. Constance was bold and determined at first, and then she turns all cowardly. It didn’t make sense.<br/><br/>-The romance felt forced. It clearly was established to make the story interesting. I don’t think it worked.<br/><br/>-I loved the relationship between Theo and Constance.

Being the football captain at their school; she was equally loved and respected. But one night, Kayla is found dead of heroin overuse at a party.

This is the story of how they come to terms with her death, dealing with the negativity that came with it, and supporting each other throughout its aftermath.<br/><br/><U>THOUGHTS</U><br/><br/>This book did have its good points, it is well written, is more emotional than structural, the characters feel realistic and relatable. It had a good message, but I think it failed in its efforts to convey it meaningfully. The story is simply full of grief and sadness, and is far too stretched out for the reader to identify and sympathize for the characters. <br/><br/>Cass and Sarah, while we get to see their pain and love for their friend, I wish we had more of their lives, about themselves, of what actually happened, of their role in everything.<br/><br/>The book is just all about Kayla and by the end of it, we don’t even know her that well. The author justifies the lack of happenings in the book as being ‘emotional’ and more about the mentality of the characters, which in my personal opinion, wasn’t quite enough. Maybe my inability to sympathize for Sarah, Cass and Paul might be because I’ve never been in their position. I did try to understand, and on one level I’m sure I did, but then it got boring soon.<br/><br/><b>Overall, </b>a simple story with a lot of emotional appeal.

And also-sadly-things that I can never be.</b></i></blockquote><br/><br/><br/><b>Someone Like You</b> – It seems I have a thing for that phrase. It is one of my favorite songs, and it is also, undoubtedly one of my favorite books. Look, I am not saying that this book is a great piece of literature – it isn’t. But sometimes, you just need to sit back, relax, and read a book, just to seek pleasure. Because if you read this book with a critic’s mind, you’ll do just that – criticize. And you’ll find many points to back you up. But for once, if you decide to read just for the sheer pleasure of it, to enjoy yourself, to marvel at life, to take yourself on a nostalgic trip, to make you want to cuddle in bed, then – Read this book.<b> It was absolutely adorable yet heartbreaking, and I enjoyed every moment.</b><br/><br/>A week before starting college as a freshman, <b>Niharika Singh</b> visits her sister in Delhi. She has never been much beauty-conscious, but now that she is going to college, her sister<b> Simran </b>insists on a makeover. With newfound confidence in herself and her looks, Niharika also attracts <b>Akshat Verma</b>, a filthy rich guy, who is ever the gentleman. His perfect looks and demeanor instantly gets her and they go on a few dates. But this relationship is short-lived as she soon discovers Akshat had dated Simran. <br/><br/>Once in college, Niharika meets <b>Tanmay,</b> a cute, nerdy guy and they hit it off instantly. Her roommate <b>Pia</b> also enters the team, and they become an inseparable trio. There is also this mysterious guy <b>Karthik,</b> who is the college’s heartthrob. Niharika finds herself intrigued by him, but she knows better than to go by looks, thanks to Akshat. <br/><b><br/>A stalker who insists he’s changed for good, a guy who seems to be more than his looks, a roommate struggling to maintain a long-distance relationship, a guy friend who’s changing by the day – Niharika does have a story to tell.<br/><br/> <br/>The book is written in a simple, lucid prose, </b>which suits the story surprisingly well. Durjoy and Nikita have a great coordination, and you simply cannot<b> NOT </b>notice the way they have blended both their voices as one. There wasn’t a moment to be bored. The plot is fast-paced, but it did take some time to gear up in the beginning. <br/><br/>There is love of all kinds – sibling-love, family-love, friendship, insta-love and a splash of romance. There is joy and elation. There is heartbreak and grief. And the best part is that the authors make sure you feel them all along with the characters.<br/><br/><br/><b>Also – the characters.</b> I really loved Niharika, the protagonist. She is innocent, sweet and naïve. I could relate to her on many levels. Some might find her to be flat and blunt, but for me her character was perfectly well-defined. Akshat, Tanmay, Karthik, Simran, Pia – each and every one of them were developed in such a realistic way that I wondered if it was a true story. But no, it is all fiction – all the more reason to compliment the authors for the great job they did.<br/><br/><br/><b>The climax, </b>even if I was forewarned, even if this was a reread, made me cry – again. It isn’t suspenseful or anything, but the whole book is like a feel-good Bollywood movie – of the best kind. The romance is there – but it isn’t cheesy. The guy is villainy – but not tough. The girl is innocent – but not stupid. Everything is just in the exact place.<br/><br/><br/><b>Overall, </b> if you are looking for a good contemporary read, pick this one next time. I’m sure it wouldn’t disappoint. The characters were remarkable and will stay with me for life. The plot wasn’t all that extraordinary, but good enough to be cherished. For smiles, cuddles, tears and all things warm <b>5/5 stars </b> for sure.",,,2,,,0,,,,,

This book is one of those which you cannot read in one sitting, which grows on you with time, and demands very little attention. In this way, <b>this book is going to blow your mind.</b> But, NO, Shamsie has also done a fine job of <b>OFFENDIG ALL THE MUSLIMS OUT THERE</b><br/><br/><br/><b>Home Fire is the story of three siblings, the politics and nations they involve with, the choices they make, and the ones they regret. </b><br/><br/>Isma meets Eamonn one fine day as normally as how two strangers collide. But thereon begins a complicated relationship which ends when Eamonn learns of Isma’s distorted family background.<br/> <br/>Eamonn, the son of the powerful Home Secretary Karamat Lone, then happens to meet Aneeka –Isma’s sister –a charming young lady, who is initially hostile with him. They both develop a mutual infatuation for each other. This relationship doesn’t go well with Karamat Lone, as Isma and Aneeka are practicing muslims, while the Lones are not. Also, the family has had a history of brewing terrorists. But when Parvaiz –Aneeka’s twin –goes in search of answers about their father, Aneeka is forced to seek Eamonn’s help. <br/><br/><b>Written in brilliant prose and a careful narrative through four people, this book depicts the complicated subject of religion, politics, history and relationships.</b><br/><br/><br/>- <b>The writing?</b> Absolutely brilliant. Clever. Practiced. The attention to details is amazing.<br/><br/>- I am also blown by how accurately Shamsie trusts her readers to feel just the way she wants them to.<br/><br/>- Throughout the book, I never did feel any emotions; neither did I care for any of the characters. <br/><br/>- But I am still wondering why I feel positive about this book.<br/><br/>- This book is certainly a mind-effer.<br/><br/>- Okay, now for the REAL PART<br/><br/>- <b>What stigmatic version of Islam was portrayed here?</b> <br/><br/>- One<b> I STRONGLY DISAGREE</b> with.<br/><br/>- Seriously, the depiction of Muslims in this book was a social humiliation to all rest of us out here.<br/><br/>- <blockquote><b><i>Friends don’t let friends be hipsters</b></i></blockquote><br/><br/>- Why Shamsie, why? Why do you have to degrade Muslims this way?<br/><br/>- Because, I am telling you people, the one depicted in this book is not even close to the REAL thing.<br/><br/>- Like, which Muslim woman would have sex with a total stranger one day and put on a hijab to pray the next morning? <br/><br/>- <b>THAT IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.</B><br/><br/>- Bloody girl, either you take off your hijab and go be a whore OR you stop declaring you are a Muslim.<br/><br/>- Because, no, you cannot do it all at once. It is humiliating to the rest of us.<br/><br/>- Throughout the book, I felt the religion being mocked at, the author’s sarcasm makes itself clear.<br/><br/>- THAT, I CANNOT TOLERATE. Sorry, you lost some stars there.<br/><br/><b>Overall</b> this book is a fine one,<b> with a story to tell, but not a message as a whole. </b>It conveys meanings through its many lines, but I couldn’t tell what it is actually meant to do as a whole. <br/>My initial reaction was 3.5, but here it is, <b>2.5/5 stars</b><br/><br/>Favorite line – <br/><br/><blockquote><b>Well, you obviously don’t love anyone very much if your love is contingent on them always staying the same</b></blockquote>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It can be recycled or thrown away completely. It isn’t this sacred treasure chest I mistook it to be. We were something, but history isn’t enough to keep something alive forever.” </i></b></blockquote><br/><br/>Okay, so THIS BOOK. Despite all the five-star reviews on my feed, I didn’t expect much. And needless to say, this book didn’t deliver – or rather – <b>tried too hard to deliver</b> that the message got lost along the way. <b>2.5/5 stars.</b><br/><br/><i>Minor spoilers ahead</i><br/><br/><u>THE PLOT</U><br/><br/>Griffin. He has two best friends. He loves one of them. They become a couple. Boyfriend moves away to college. So Griffin breaks up. Guy gets another boyfriend. Griffin gets jealous. Everyone moves on. Guy dies. Everyone blames themselves. Ex and had-been boyfriends hook up. They regret. Everyone moves on. Griffin dates his other best friend. And they live <u> ____________</u>.<br/><br/>There is also this OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) Griffin has, which is also kind of a major plot device, though it doesn’t take over the whole story or anything. But. >> There is always a BUT. <<<br/><br/><b>Disclaimer: There is heavy LGBTQ content, and same-gender-sex, be warned if you are sensitive to the subject</b><br/><br/><br/>Let me start on a good note – <br/><br/><b>THE WRITING WAS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT.</B> Adam Silvera’s smooth, poetic way of telling the tale was really enjoyable. I couldn’t stop admiring all the ways in which he had incorporated simple gestures and observations into his words, and polished them to something heartfelt. <br/><br/>That is where the good things end.<br/><br/>Firstly, <b>the plot</b><br/><br/>There was nothing compelling me to read on. It was very boring at times. The time wrap between the past and present took some time to get used to, and even then, there wasn’t anything in it which told me to read on. <br/><br/>Let’s see, we know Theo, Griffin's boyfriend, dies right from the beginning, because well, the title is obvious enough. So there had to be something in it which we would be looking forward to, right? Like, a how, why and what. But no, all we got was Griffin constantly complaining how it is so very unfair for Theo to die, how he can’t live without him. <b>It got boring pretty damn soon.</b><br/><br/>While the whole idea of reliving history and the memories-are-all-that’s-left thing seems compelling, it was repeated too many times and consequentially lost its charm.<br/><br/><b>The narrative</b> <br/><br/>Like I said, the narrative alternates between the past and present, in Griffin’s point of view. But mostly it felt like an epistolary. If you know me, you should know that I am not a big fan of epistolary. So Griffin narrating or rather ‘conversing’ the whole story didn’t appeal to me.<br/><br/><b>The characters</b><br/><br/>There is Griffin, Jackson, Theo, Wade. All of them guys. It was a refreshing change to see a YA contemporary from a boy’s perspective. (But why is it that literally every YA I have read with a male protagonist is LGBTQ? Uh, never mind)<br/><br/>The main characters are all 17-19 years old. But they behaved way too childish for their age. Like, they play puzzles (all of them!), cry every minute, and hang on to their mommys. I’m not saying that every 17-year-old guys should go smoke weed and not play puzzles, but really, the way they talked and behaved seems far too childish to me. Adding to that the number of times they talk about sex, and doing reckless things like flying off to other countries - it just doesn’t match.<br/><br/>But I must say, the characters are well-defined. You can picture them exactly as described, though they do not develop much throughout the story. Did I mention that this book reminded me of several other books? Theo McIntyre reminded me so much of Theodore Finch in All the Bright Places. The similarities cannot be ignored.<spoiler> (name? obviously, the personality - the same enthusiasm for everything, the way they spoke, and, well, the way they died)</spoiler> The book also oddly reminded me of Will Grayson, Will Grayson , mostly because both are LGBTQ romance with exceptional writing and a meh plot.<br/><br/>Now, for the big part, <b>The Climax</b><br/><br/>It took almost 80% of the book for it to actually hold my interest. Even with just 300 pages, it took several days for me to finish it. But once it got to the climax, I finished it in half an hour. Is that a good thing? <b>Absolutely not.</b> It only became fast-paced because <b>SOMETHING HAPPENED</b>.<br/><br/>Let me not spoil any further, but I’ll say, the plot twist was a <b>ROMANCE</b>. Yeah, a romance with a guy who was literally non-existent till then. The main character sleeps with every other guy and thankfully settles for one in the end. Oh yes. That’s all there is. For me, it just ruined the whole book. There wasn’t a single piece of brotherhood – kinship – or friendship in this book. If there was, it was barely noticeable.<br/><br/><b>Themes</b> - There is LGBT, Mental Illness, Death, Grief. So mostly, this is a sad book. But <b>I.DIDN’T.SHED.A.SINGLE.TEAR.</B> That – is a huge disappointment for a book that was supposed to drown you in a pool of tears. I don't think this book puts forward a good message either. The characters all blame themselves for someone else's death in which they had no role in, every supposed-friendship goes awry by sex, and the OCD, while it was quite realistically potrayed, it didn't give off a positive vibe.<br/><br/><br/><b>Overall, </b> this book was certainly <b>a new reading experience</b> but that doesn’t mean I loved it. The story went all wrong in places, the characters are unremarkable, and the climax totally ruined the whole thing. So, yeah, this book didn’t work well for me. It might work for you though. Read it for the experience, nothing much of a story here. Tentatively recommended.<br/><br/><br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Being a <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/151371.Jenny_Han"">Jenny Han</a> fan, I’ve been meaning to read Siobhan Vivian for a long time now, <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10866233-the-list?from_search=true"">The List</a> certainly made me want to discover more of the author. <b>3.5/5 stars.</b><br/><br/><u>THE PLOT</u><br/><br/>A week before the homecoming dance, the students of Mount Washington High come to school to find a list taped and stapled to doors, lockers, notice boards and everywhere else. It isn’t something extraordinary, just a list declaring the prettiest and the ugliest girl in each year, except, it IS a big deal. No one knows who prepares the list; it has been a tradition for so long. This year, eight girls find themselves in spotlight after the list is published. <br/><br/><b>Abby Warner</b> - a clueless freshman, looking forward to have an enjoyable high school period. Like all girls her age, she wants to look pretty, impress boys and be admired. The list only helps her cause, or so she thinks.<br/><br/><b>Danielle DeMarco</b> - highly talented swimmer; selected to the varsity team. The list does nothing to her confidence, but not everyone else is pacified with her indifference – including her boyfriend.<br/><br/><b>Candace Kincaid</b> - She knows she is pretty, and so does everyone else. And yet the list naming her the ugliest sophomore makes everyone to reconsider their beauty standards and in turn, Candace finds herself abandoned by her closest friends.<br/><br/><b>Lauren Finn</b> - Being homeschooled, Lauren has no much idea about school and friends. UNTIL THE LIST HAPPENED. Being the prettiest sophomore, a bunch of girls are suddenly eager for her friendship. Lauren has to figure out who’s earnest and who’s not.<br/><br/><b>Sarah Singer</b> - When the list pronounces that she is trying to be as ugly as possible, Sarah becomes determined to meet their expectations and show them how ugly actually looks like. But how good is her façade?<br/><br/><b>Bridget Honeycutt</b> - Being on the list was hard work, and even harder is maintaining her title of the prettiest girl. The constant need to eat coincides with a desperation to prove the list right, and Bridget must make sure not to stagger under the pressure.<br/><br/><b>Jennifer Briggis</b> - Being the ugliest for four years, Jennifer has developed an immunity to the list and unexpectedly, draws pity from others. People hail her for her bravery and even go as far as to nominate her for homecoming queen – Jennifer doesn’t mind the attention. <br/><br/><b>Margo Gable</b> - Becoming the homecoming queen was a given for Margo. Being the prettiest senior also strengthens her chances. But Jennifer has a fan base of her own too. Uncovering a secret and being guilty of one of her own, Margo finds herself in the midst of confusion and betrayal.<br/><br/>	<br/><b>The book is narrated in eight povs.</b>  Yeah, you heard that right – 8 povs. Most of the books can’t even properly deal with a single character, but here Siobhan Vivian has done a splendid job by offering each girl’s perspectives with stunning clearness. There wasn’t a single moment when I got the names and characters all tangled up. Even with all the characters and all the issues it deals with, the book isn’t messy. <br/><br/><b>The characters also have a lot of depth in them.</b> Each girl is unique in her own way and seem <b>very real. <br/><br/>DISCLAIMER: There is a lot of body-shaming in this book. Like, in every chapter. It also deals with eating disorder. </b> But, these themes are just a part of the drama and does not try to overpower the book.<br/><br/>I am amazed by how perfectly Vivian has captured the emotions and feelings of each of the characters. Sarah’s attitude, Danielle’s mask-face, Bridget’s turmoil, Lauren’s mindset, every other character has been given particular characteristics and they’re portrayed in a very symbolic way. <br/><br/><b>But, the book is not without it’s flaws</b>. Some of the characters were given so little time of appearance, that somewhat diminishes their significance in the story. For example, Candace is indicated to be a bad person, but we do not get any clarifications or explanations or flashbacks of any sort. <b>The whole book seems incomplete.</b> <br/>There were MANY THINGS that were not explained. It affects the way readers connect to the characters. <br/><br/>And HOW ABSURD WAS THAT ENDING? I seriously thought my book was missing pages. It was as if the author was rushing to meet a deadline to finish the book and in the process forgot to clarify what was to be the end of the story. I mean how do you deal with something so.. <i>incomplete</i>?? Like, what happened to Sarah? Was Lauren able to convince her mom? What about Abby? Daniel? Did Candace have a change of mind? And what about Jennifer? How did they all deal with those things? So many questions! And not a glimpse of an answer -.-<br/><br/><b>Overall, </b> the book doesn’t end on a completely positive note, which was what I expected. With all the themes addressed here, in the end they felt scattered, lay about. I really wish the author had bothered to give some more insight, a personal touch to the whole thing.<br/> Either way, if you love contemporaries, chick-lit, and lots of high-school drama, then this book is for you.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I loved her writing style, the way she told a story with a simple but important message. UNTIL NOW. Not sure why this book differed from her usual prose, but it failed to strike a chord.<br/><br/><b>It’s All In The Planets, </b>like the title indicates, is a story of two people ‘fated’ to be together. Aniket, a software developer and Nidhi, a blogger, meet on a train trip to Chennai, their hometown. By the end of their trip, they’ve begun to talk like old pals, and Nidhi promises to be Aniket’s relationship cum diet instructor. <br/><br/>Aniket is deeply in love with Trish, a model known for her stunning beauty. On the other hand, Nidhi is on the brink of a breakup with her fiancé Manoj, who she discovers is a bit of an abuser when she refuses to leave her job and live with him in USA. Both Aniket and Nidhi cross paths more than once and become good friends.<br/><br/>In an unfortunate turn of events, they find solace in each other’s company and discover that life does not go as planned. However hard we try, we cannot escape facing the realities fate has in store for us.<br/><br/>There were many things in this book that didn’t work for me.<b> The writing seemed far too plain. </b>But on a positive note it was extremely straightforward and easy-to-read. The book is written in dual narratives of Aniket and Nidhi. While that might have been a good idea, <b>the author repeats the same incidents and dialogues in both the perspectives.</b> This repetition was boring, and I found myself skim reading such paragraphs. Each of the chapters is topped with the daily horoscope of the main characters by a seemingly popular astrologer, Darshita Sen who also makes an appearance in the story. I couldn’t help feeling that these predictions were <b>far too accurate to be believable.</b><br/><br/>One of my biggest issues with book was its <b>characters</b>. I hated Nidhi as well as Aniket, right from the beginning. Nidhi is a self-obsessed woman who wants the world to revolve around her. The way she dismissed Manoj, her fiancé, without so much as an explanation made me really angry. Her concept about romance is quite stupid, proven by the way she thought she ‘loved’ Aniket. <b>There was ZERO CHEMISTRY between the leads</b>. As for Aniket, he was slightly more bearable, which is still not much. He is a dreamy-eyed boy with the I-have-a-sexy-girlfriend-and-I-want-to-keep-her-forever attitude. Every other minute he tries to convince us how pretty his girlfriend is and how much he loves her. I was soon fed up, like, ‘Bro, I get that she’s pretty, now could you please move on?’. Btw did I mention that his tone didn’t even feel like that of a boy?<br/><br/><blockquote><b><i>Death is a finality that none of us can escape. Yet, we live pretending it doesn’t exist</i></b></blockquote><br/><br/>The plot was <b>VERY PREDICTABLE</b> for major parts of the book and yet the climax came unexpectedly. The author is very good at <b>describing feelings and emotions. </b>The characters speak in a philosophical manner which I thought was rather not relatable. And also the simple picture of an Indian household is described remarkably well, even if that doesn’t cover much of the book. I loved the little observations Shenoy has made on relationships, family, friends and emotions. <br/><br/><b><i><blockquote>How easy it is to placate parents. Do exactly as they want you to. Listen to everything they say. Put aside your hopes, your ambitions, your individuality, and they are happy</blockquote></i><br/><br/>Overall,</b> the book was a quick, unremarkable read, with meh characters and an even more boring story. There were no elements of surprise, no awe-inspiring moments. <br/><br/>For people who have only recently ventured into reading, this book might be appealing. Otherwise, you may want to avoid this one.<br/><br/><i><blockquote>Cherish happy memories. Create amazing ones",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Kelley Armstrong did a good job with the psychology element, but not quite with the suspense.<br/><br/><i><blockquote>Reeve’s End is the kind of town every kid can’t wait to escape. Each summer, a dozen kids leave and at least a quarter never come back. I don’t blame them—I’ll do the same in another year. We thought it was just something that happened in towns like ours.<br/>   We were wrong.</i></blockquote><br/><br/><b>Missing </b>is a psychological thriller about a town – Reeves End, which according to <b>Winter Crane</b> is the least livable place in the world. She hunts down rabbits and deer for food; she lives in a trailer at the border of a forest and endures an abusive drunkard of a father each night.<br/> While on a hunt in the forest, she comes across<b> Lennon Bishop</b>. He had come to Reeve’s End searching for Edie who’s been missing, and he was attacked at the forest. Winter rescues him from a pack of feral dogs, brings him to her shack, and vows to help him find Edie. But Lennon takes off himself. His brother <b>Jude Bishop</b>, comes searching for him and encounters Winter and they start their search together. <br/>A psycho killer is on the loose – he has killed the feral dogs, kidnapped Edie and Winter’s sister Cadence, and probably Lennon. The question is, who is he? Why is he doing this?<br/><br/><b>TRIGGER WARNING: GRAPHIC VIOLENCE, MURDER AND TOO MUCH BLOOD</b><br/><br/>♦▫<b>Winter.</b> She is a horribly confusing main character. There were many instances where I wanted to slap her hard, and at the same time, sometimes she was easily relatable. I was surprisingly moved when she opened her mind about her family and sister – her personality was unpredictable. At times, she’d be totally cool about ripping off a rabbit skin, and the next moment she’d be horrified when someone gets a broken wrist. <br/><br/> ♦▫<b>The writing was endurable.</b> Nothing much there, but the way the author describes bloodshed and violence like they’re our everyday soap-opera – made me gag. There is brutal violence and a psycho who kills just for the fun of it. <b><u>Definitely not for the faint-hearted.</b></u><br/><br/>♦▫<b>The romance.</b> While I did expect there to be a romance in the plot, what I did not expect was to fall for it. It was pleasant and warm – not too much of it, just the right amount. <br/><br/>♦▫<b>The characters.</b> They weren’t realistic, but they weren’t cardboard cut-outs either. I loved Jude right from the start, and Lennon was also fairly lovable. I had my issues with Winter, but then when the veil lifted and I was able to actually understand her, she was good too. (Ah! And how I wish I could hear Jude play the piano?! *sigh*)<br/><br/>♦▫<b>There were definite loopholes in the plot.</b> The book was engaging and engrossing, but the whole kidnapping-murdering thing felt short of actual planning. It was confusing at times to match one point with the other, and even after the ending, I don’t think everything exactly fell into place. <br/><br/>♦▫<b>The suspense and ending.</b> The ending was too abrupt and the author didn’t bother with much explanations. Many questions were left unanswered. I knew better than to suspect anyone to be the killer (because thrillers these days just make up characters at the end and entitle them as ‘killers’ and that’s what happened here too). I JUST AM NOT SATISFIED WITH HOW IT ENDED.<br/><br/><u>VERDICT</u><br/>As is common with psychological thrillers, it took me a while to get into the story. There were many things that just didn’t suit my taste. I was pretty sure it was going to be 1-star read, but then I sort of got used to the style and found myself enjoying the book in the end, albeit a little unsatisfied. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I like the original idea - a scavenger hunt for revenge. It had much potential, but the execution failed miserably. <b>2.5/5 stars.</b><br/><br/><b>The Rules </b>tells the story of a bunch of teens, who play the scavenger hunt at a party in an abandoned cannery. But things go horribly wrong when one by one, each of them are killed. August DeYoung had planned the party and the hunt in hope of making his friends realise how unfair they were to his sister Alexa, which ultimately lead to her death. But then, August's plans aren't the ones carried out. Or was it? They must all play by the rules, or be ready to die.<br/><br/><b>WARNING: There's a lot of violence and murder in this book. </b><br/><br/><b>The beginning of the book</b> itself was a big NO for me. I knew then and there that I wouldn't like this one. There were so many characters and so many '<i>rules</i>'. None of the characters had any depth to them, none of them were made to be likeable. For the first time, <i>the multiple povs sucked.</i>There was nothing urging us to read on. The tangled mess of characters and their stupid rules were difficult to follow. At the end of the book, I'm pretty sure I can't even remember most of their names. <br/><br/><b>And that ending?</b> <s>WTF</s>?! Okay, I geddit, it's a big twist and all, but seriously? Just for the sake of the plot, one of characters just switched on to an entire new personality and turned out to be the killer! I didn't like any part of it. <u>The beginning and the ending seemed to be from two entirely different books.</u> The book obviously lacked good planning.<br/><br/>Maybe if the authors had tried to put some more <i>emotions</i> to the characters, it'd have turned out fine.

It was <i>too similar</i> and <i>too soon</i>. Don't get me wrong, this one's a good book. Just that the similarities between the aforementioned books and this one, put me off in the beginning. Otherwise, it was quite good. <br/><br/>Told in alternating perspectives of four characters, One Of Us is Lying is a suspense thriller with murder and a typical whodunnit plot. <br/><b>Simon, </b>the gossip king of Bayview High runs an app <u>About That </u> which targets the school students and all the secrets they hope to hide. During detention class with Nate, Cooper, Bronwyn and Addy for bringing phones to Mr. Avery's class, Simon drops dead of allergic reaction while drinking water. The four remaining students are the prime suspects, especially after it's out that Simon had meant to post dirty secrets of them the day after. But the four, now accused to be The Murder Club, insists that they're framed. So, <b>who is lying? Why would they be framed? Who is the actual culprit? Keep guessing</b><br/><br/><b><u>What was GOOD and what was not </b></u><br/><br/>☞ <b>The alternating narrators. </b>Even if it is annoying at first, the multiple pov thing is always interesting (even if the narrators aren't completely straightforward). The way we get to see through the minds of all four of the suspects, kinda broaden our own perspectives.<br/><br/>☞<b>The romance.</b>Yeah, even with all the murder-suspect background, the romance was what intrigued me the most. I loved Nate and Bronwyn, and I loved the way the author kept their story going in the end. It wasn't the kind of fairytale romance that makes readers drool, but the kind that happens in real life - realistic in short.<br/><br/>☞<b>The suspense build up was carried out efficiently. </b>I loved that things didn't come all of a sudden. There was room for guessing and the writing intensified as the plot progressed. As a reader, I felt <i>involved</i> in the story and I think it is important for a book to make sure it's readers feel that way.<br/><br/>☞<b>I felt the start to be a bit dragged out. </b>And the characters were a bit unreliable sometimes. They wouldn't reveal things about themselves which we expect to know while reading from their pov. <br/><br/>☞<b>The suspense was an easy guess.</b> I correctly guessed the culprit through the middle of the book. Even then the book was no less appealing, so that might be something.<br/><br/><b>Overall, </b>this book is a great debut and Karen McManus did a great job with the story. <br/>If you are new to the suspense thriller genre, then this book would definitely be a good way to start. If you are familiar with the genre, then there isn't anything new here. But it still is worth a try. <b>3.5/5 stars.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Yeah, I thought it was awful in the beginning and I had <i>almost</i> dnf-ed it, but now, I'm just grateful I didn't. <br/><br/><b>First of all - This book isn't neccessarily YA. There are a lot of cussing, and I mean <i>a lot</i>. Also there's quite a bit of lgbt content. You have been warned.</b><br/><br/>Let's get to the story, shall we? Will Grayson and Will Grayson are two very different people living their own lives in two different places. They happen to meet by chance <spoiler>in a porn store</spoiler> due to very different circumstances. (I'll hereby refer to Will Grayson - written by John Green, as Will and the other Will Grayson, written by David Levithan as will. Notice the difference? That's how it is in the book too, btw)<br/><br/>Will Grayson , is straight, lives by his rules, and has the very huge Tiny Cooper, who's gay, for a best friend. He wasn't that into Jane, until he discovers she's dating another guy and suddenly realises he likes her. Things aren't very well with him and Tiny. Tiny has decided to put up a musical drama and spends his whole time preparing for it, which makes Will feel avoided. He encounters the other will grayson, and so does Tiny. will(who's also gay) and Tiny, suddenly gets to each other and Will feels abandoned again. The way these three people makes and breaks each other and realise that life isn't good until you make it to be, is what forms the rest of the story.<br/><br/><b>THOUGHTS</b><br/>*- <b>The writing.</b> I've always known this about him, so I shouldn't have been surprised by the way John Green (and also David Levithan) phrases his sentences beautifully, but I was. The one and only reason I decided not to dnf this at start was because of the writing. It's outright brilliant. And really, no one other than John Green could possibly make vomiting sound funny!<br/><br/><blockquote><i>""I thought it would be Tiny at the door, brimming with apologies I would slowly accept. But such is life. We grow up. Planets like Tiny get new moons. Moons like me get new planets.""</i></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><i>""You like someone who can't like you back because unrequited love can be survived in a way once-requited love cannot""</i></blockquote><br/><br/>*- <b>It isn't the story that I loved,</b> there isn't much to it. It's the way, the authors chose to tell the story - through thoroughly flawed characters, who aren't very likeable, but  say and do the right things. There just was something more to the story than meets the eye. The idea of two characters written by two people, is kinda interesting.<br/><br/>*-<b>I know I have said this </b>,and I say it again - John Green is one brilliant man. He's the kind who is very  creative when it comes to words, but not when it comes to stories. I wish he used his brilliance to create something more complex and imaginative, something more <i>real</i>, or just put more thought to the story than writing it as it went along (that's how it feels anyway)<br/><br/>*- There was this one time, when I felt like the characters did nothing but use expletives, annoy you, and talk about sex and penises like they are child's play. And there was another time, when I felt like the characters are kids trapped in an adults body, made to speak like adults. Those two doesn't go well together you, know?<b> The book was sometimes contradictory to itself.</b><br/><br/>*-<b>The characters in this book speak in long sentences,</b> and by long, I mean <i>really long</i>. It was annoying and amazing how these people could speak in one sentences, more than I spoke in a day. That's another problem with the book -<b> it isn't realistic</b>. There's no way there exist such characters as in the book, no way kids speak in such long sentences, no way teenagers put more thought and imagination to a sentence that <i>spontaneously</i>. You get my point? No? Well, that's John Green for you.<br/><br/>All said, this book was an enjoyable read. I is thoughtful, humourous and entertaining. The ending might have been a bit dramatic, but for making me <i>think</i> in one way and other, I would rate it <b>3.5/5</b><br/><br/><blockquote><i>""Caring doesn't sometimes lead to misery, it always does""</i></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><i>""The things you hope for the most are the things that destroy you in the end""</i></blockquote>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

His younger brothers aren't taking it well, and his father is oblivious to their feelings. He makes friends in the neighbourhood and that's where he sees Amirah, his friend Zayd's sister. Amirah is an art lover, who has sworn she would never marry, after seeing all that her mother had gone through. As practicing muslims, Ali and Amirah do not have dating in their mind. But after their first encounter, all they can do is think of each other. Is there a halal way around it? Would they be able to pursue their feelings while staying true to their faith at the same time?<br/><br/><b>MY THOUGHTS </b><br/>Let me say, this book was <b>NOT</b> what I was expecting. It has done a really good job of potraying <i>ISLAM</i> as the <i>peaceful</i> religion it is. Without sounding preachy, it gives us a fairly good idea of the religion. <br/><br/><b>And the characters. They felt so real, it was almost scary. </b>It felt as if they were <i>actually</i> speaking to us.<br/>And Amirah! OMG. I have read many books where I related to the character, but none as much as I did here. She loves art. Check. She reads. Check. She is a muslim. Check. It was as if someone stole the ramblings off my messy mind and carved them into meaningful lines. I'm not even pissed. Amirah is TRUE. Amirah is <i>ME</i>. (Or my long lost twin). 'Nuff said.<br/><br/><b>VERDICT</b><br/>Now that I <i>really</i> think about it, the romance does seem a bit clichéd. The ending was also dramatic. Some people might find the dialect problematic, but to me it was just... cute. <br/><br/>This isn't your usual romance, it has a life of it's own. The way Na'ima Roberts has written this wonderful book with real-as-hell characters is just WOW. I'm not kidding. Read it for yourself. <br/><blockquote><i> If there's one thing I have learned about in life, it's this:<br/>When you're not supposed to do something, you will find it near impossible to resist and when you have to do something, you'll find any number of excuses to avoid doing it.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Not much of my expectations were met though.<br/><br/><b>OVERVIEW</b><br/>Samiullah and Fathima are childhood friends. He is a Pashtun boy and she is a Hazara girl. They should have known better than to grow fond of each other. But still, they can't resist falling in love. In the land of Taliban, love like their's is not greeted without contempt. Samiullah's cousin Rashid is bent down on punishing them for their offensive act of falling in love. It is not only them but also their families who must face the consequences. Will their love survive? Would Rashid be condecending enough to spare their love, and life?<br/><br/><B>My thoughts</b><br/><br/>¤ ~<b> The premise was promising -</b> A tale of forbidden love in Afghanistan. But the story felt short of love. Samiullah and Fatima's love story felt just like a 'story' to me, almost forced. Not that I expected any romance. But still, I didn't understand their love and couldn't sympathize for them.<br/><br/>¤ ~ <b>The characters lack a certain depth. </b>I couldn't feel for any of them. I didn't feel any grief or pain on the deaths.<br/><br/>¤ ~<b> The writing felt... flat.</b> I was emotionless throughout the book. Even if the story was touchy, it earned no sympathy from me. Absolutely none. <br/><br/>¤ ~ I liked the way Atia Abawi blended common observations into her story. It added to the appeal. <br/> Like this -<br/><br/><blockquote><i> ""I don't stare. Instead I quickly grab some raw dough and stick it to my mouth before running off, barely in time to save myself from a swat from my aunt's rolling pin.""</blockquote><br/><br/>Or even this,<br/><br/><blockquote><i>""Behind him is the four-year-old concentrating on a plate full of nuts and candy, obviously afraid of dropping it. Mullah Sarwar kisses him after he succesfully sets the plate down infront of us""</blockquote></i><br/><br/>¤ ~ <b>The narrative was very clever. </b>The way it alternates between Samiullah, Rashid and Fathima's perspective, let's us know what was happening behind the scenes. <br/><br/>¤ ~ <b>There was nothing new to the story.</b> I could predict every part of it, even the deaths.<spoiler>Fathima's sister Afo is killed in absence of her as a punishment to her family</spoiler>. It was a huge turn-off for me. I'm not usually a I-know-what-is-gonna-happen soert of reader. But this book was plain and lacked intensity, I had it all figured out.<br/><br/><b>VERDICT</b><br/>I liked the book but did not like the book. I liked it because it successfully portrays the ethnic cultural differences and the hardships of women's life in Afghanistan. Other than that there wasn't much that appealed to me in this book.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The title was the first thing that grabbed me and then, well, it's Khaled Hosseini writing, so expectations were indeed soaring high after The Kite Runner.<br/>So glad, that it indeed was way above my expectations.<br/><br/>Everyone knows what the book is about. So I won't bother much. The lives of young Laila and Mariam are intertwined with fate at the house of Rasheed. They take some time to know that both of them have had a sad past. And now, they must set their strengths to face all the hardships, living in a country where women are seriously undervalued. <br/><br/>This hauntingly beautiful book took me about half of the book to get me ACTUALLY hooked. Yeah, that long! But voila! And then it rose up high up to my favorite list. Even from a women's point of view, Khaled weaves a brilliant tale that doesn't fail to bring forward the true emotions of the blessed gender. The characters were fresh (though some were unrealistically portrayed) and the writing was really good. The story itself is enough to haunt you for a lifetime. Besides, you get to know a lot about the cultures and history of a foreign place which is  a really good plus point. I was open-mouthed at the end, not because of the way it ended, but it was way too good to end and let go. <br/>Mariam and Laila have captured my heart and rest-assured, their tale would definitely be one of the reasons you'd catch me sobbing late into the night.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

At least not in the way non-Indian books have. But I do try to read Indian books every once in a while hoping for the 'ultimate one'. <br/>With R.K Narayan's ""The Guide"", I've sort of mixed feelings. I did really like this book, but I'm not sure why. The narrative was captivating, the story was well-told, characters were developed. I also enjoyed the virtual tour through Malgudi. But somewhere along, the plotline seemed to miss that extra-punch I expected when I first started the book. The story of a tourist-guide-turned-criminal-turned-saint does make you marvel but will also leave you speechless when asked about what you just read (confusing uh? read the book and you'll get what I'm talking about-probably).<br/><br/>I do recommend this book for anyone who wants to read Indian, for it is one of the best quality ones of the kind I've read so far.

Being an Indian myself, I feel dishonored to read an Indian book which has basically no literary value. This book is a must read for people who aspire to be a writer - it screams at every word, how you can't be one. <br/><br/>This book tells the story of Rahul in the Chetan-Bhagat sort of way, the author is traveling in a train, meets a fellow traveler to whom he narrates the story. Rahul is abused as a child, he is brilliant in academics, is gay, and is used by literally everyone he encounters in his journey for life, love, money, and justice. The description seems to be promising, but I tell you, this book has not got anything worth your time. The main character is a flawed one. He boasts of being the good guy always, while in reality he is as foolish as anyone can get. <br/>Homosexuality, prostitution are encouraged in this book. It asks for the Indian government to legalize prostitution saying it's the best way for unmarried men to relieve their physical needs! How cheap can a book get? This book tantalizes the Indian men, society, judiciary, culture in every way possible. I'm wondering why I even put up with it till the end. It never once gabbed my attention, is written in the worst possible readable-English, has no pros to boast of. Anyway, I'm done! God bless, all those who even think of reading the book to see why it's bad.!",,,1,,,0,,,,,
